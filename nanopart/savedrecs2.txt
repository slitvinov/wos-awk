   colloidal aqueous solutions of ultrasmall (1.8-1.9 nm) CdSe particles,
   characterized by a narrow size distribution and photoluminescence in
   the visible region of the spectrum with quantum yields up to 12% and
   decay constants in the range 10(-1) to 10(2) ns. A similar approach was
   used to obtain colloids of nanoparticles of a CdSxSe1-x solid solution
   with a tailored composition.

AB Laboratory methods are developed for forming an active layer (AL) with
   a synthesized PtCoCr catalyst (20 wt % Pt) on the F-950 perfluorinated
   membrane. AL composition and the conditions for forming 3- and 5-layer
   membrane-electrode assemblies (MEA) are optimized. Reproducible,
   stable, and high-discharge characteristics are obtained for a
   hydrogen-air fuel cell (HAFC). At a current density of 0.5 A/cm(2), the
   voltage of an MEA with cathode based on a PtCoCr catalyst is 0.66-0.68
   V, and the maximum power density is 500 mW/cm(2). Replacing the
   commercial HiSPEC 4000 catalyst (40 wt % Pt) with PtCoCr (20 wt % Pt)
   in the AL composition of the cathode makes it possible to reduce Pt
   consumption by a factor of two without decreasing MEA discharge
   characteristics. The parameters that characterize the catalytic
   activity of catalysts under model conditions and in the MEA cathode
   composition are shown to be correlated.

AB A lipid membrane is a main component of biological membranes.
   Contemporary bionanotechnologies use phospholipids and ceramides as
   basic components of drugs and cosmetic preparations.
   Phospholipids-based nanoparticles are used as drug carriers. Effective
   development of bionanotechnologies in Russia calls for creation of
   physical methods to diagnose the particle nanostructure which would be
   promising for application in pharmacology. Radiation with wavelengths
   of 1-10 is an adequate instrument for detecting the nanostructure of
   lipid bi- and monolayers.
   The review deals with methods that apply neutron scattering and
   synchrotron radiation for studying nanostructures of lipid membranes,
   phospholipid nanoparticles, and phospholipid monolayers on a water
   surface by techniques of diffraction, small-angle scattering, and
   reflectometry. The importance of the mutually complementary application
   of neutron and synchrotron radiation for solving urgent problems of
   membrane biophysics, microbiology, dermapharmacology, and
   bionanotechnologies is demonstrated by particular examples of studies
   of phospholipid membranes and ceramide-based membranes. The efficiency
   of development and application of new methods for solving urgent
   problems of biophysics is shown.
   The review is written on the basis of results obtained over the period
   of 1999-2010 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR)
   Laboratory of Neutron Physics in collaboration with the Pharmaceutical
   Departments of universities of France (Paris-Sud, Chatenay Malabry) and
   Germany (Martin Luther University, Halle). The experiments were
   performed at various European and Russian neutron and synchrotron
   sources.

   linear arrays of plasmonic nanoparticles, operating as optical
   'two-line' waveguides. Compared to linear arrays of nanoparticles, our
   results suggest that these waveguides may support more confined beams

   analogously to transmission-line segments at lower frequencies. Our
   formulation fully takes into account the entire dynamic interaction
   among the infinite number of nanoparticles composing the parallel
   arrays, considering also the realistic presence of losses and the
   frequency dispersion of the involved plasmonic materials, providing
   physical insights into the guidance properties that characterize this
   geometry.

   spin polarization of the NPs below the Fermi level. On the other hand,
   the discrete electronic states resulting from the spatially confined
   sp-like Co surface state electrons above the Fermi level are found to
   be of majority character. This confirms the theoretically predicted

AB Carbon-supported Pt catalysts prepared by the impregnation method in
   water-dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solutions were investigated. Using
   X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique for estimation of the particle size
   and shapes, we show that morphology of the Pt/C catalysts depends
   strongly on the DMSO content in the solutions. The average particles
   size reduces and a shape of the Pt nanocrystals changes from a
   truncated octahedron to a cuboctahedron and eventually to a truncated
   cube with increasing DMSO concentration in the reaction mixture.
   Antibate effects of the size and shape cause nonmonotonic dependence of
   the catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with
   electric current maximum at an average particle size of 2.7 nm.

AB Alumina- and titania-based composite coatings containing ferromagnetic
   nanoparticles have been produced on UKN-5000P carbon fibers by an in
   situ organo-inorganic hybrid sol-gel process using appropriate aqueous
   metal chloride solutions containing Fe(III) and Co(II). The morphology,
   phase composition, and elemental composition of the coatings have been
   studied by high-resolution electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and
   energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis. The results demonstrate that the
   oxide coatings containing ferromagnetic nanoparticles are uniform in
   thickness along and across the fibers and adhere well to the fiber
   surface. The coatings range in thickness from 100 to 500 nm. In all of
   the systems studied, the coatings produced on carbon fibers differ in
   phase composition from powders prepared from identical hydrosols.

ID ANATASE TIO2; EFFICIENCY; INJECTION; STATES; METAL
AB To improve the conversion efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells
   (DSSCs) it is necessary to understand the electronic structure of the
   TiO2-dye-electrolyte interface in detail. A sturdy junction at the
   interface can be provided by modifying the electronic structure of the
   TiO2 electrode with Nb doping. The Nb-doped TiO2 was prepared by a
   sol-gel method followed by a hydrothermal treatment; the Nb content was
   varied from 0.5 to 3.0 mol%. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   showed that the Fermi level of TiO2 electrode shifted away from the
   conduction band minimum (CBM) when the Nb content is low (<= 1.5 mol%)
   and shifted toward the CBM when the Nb content is high (>= 2.5 mol%).
   The shift of Fermi level with low Nb doping was due to the passivation
   of the oxygen vacancies at the TiO2 nanoparticle surface. Intraband
   states were formed when dopant content was 1.5 and 2.5 mol%. We have
   found that the photovoltaic parameters of DSSCs based on doped TiO2
   sensitized with a cis-[Ru(dcbpyH)(2)(NCS)(2)](NBu4)(2), N719 dye, are
   closely related to the electronic structure of the Nb-doped TiO2
   electrode. The changes of short circuit current and open circuit
   voltage of DSSCs were explained in relation to the electronic structure
   of the TiO2 electrode. The best efficiency of 8.0% was demonstrated by
   DSSCs with 2.5 mol% Nb-doped TiO2.

AB H-2 oxidation and preferential CO oxidation (CO-PROX) were studied over
   Au/Al2O3-catalysts with gold content 0.2-1 wt.% in a flow reactor of
   quartz.
   It is established that the reactions of H-2 oxidation and CO-PROX can
   be performed in a mode of the catalyst surface ignition (CSI). If
   temperature/gas flow rate are varied within certain limits, this mode
   can be maintained. Oxygen is the key component in CSI mode in the case
   of H-2-rich gases; its residual content is below 70 ppm. Residual
   content of CO in CSI mode depends on temperature, gradually decreasing
   upon a decrease in temperature in the "hot spot" of the reaction zone.
   In oxidation reactions conducted in CSI mode, the "hot spot" of the
   reaction zone is situated at the exit from the catalyst bed in two
   cases: when the catalysts are of low Au content, or when the
   temperature is lowered. This is a sign of catalyst deactivation at the
   entrance to the catalyst bed.
   Self-activation of the catalyst is found in both presence and absence
   of CO as a spontaneous overheat of the catalyst over time with "hot
   spot" drifting from the exit of the catalyst bed to the entrance.
   It is proposed that both deactivation and self-activation are caused by
   rival processes on the surface of gold: strong binding of oxygen and
   oxygen removal by desorption or consumption in exothermic oxidation
   processes. Thus, the positive effect of hydrogen on CO oxidation can be
   connected both with a change in ratio between different valent forms of
   gold and the conjugation of oxidation reactions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB The effect of silver ions and nanoparticles on the electrochemical
   properties of KU-2-8 sulfocationite, MF-4SK homogeneous sulfocationite
   membrane, and MA-40 heterogeneous anion-exchange membrane is studied.
   Using scanning electron microscopy, the particle distribution
   throughout the cationexchanger thickness is studied. The method of IR
   spectroscopy is used for studying the interaction of silver
   nanoparticles and ions and also of Cu2+ and Ni2+ ions with secondary
   and tertiary amino groups. It is shown that the mobilities of sodium
   and silver ions are close in sulfocationites, which suggests that
   silver ions are quickly washed out of such materials. In the
   anion-exchange membrane, silver ions are bound into complexes with
   ionogenic groups and induce an increase in the water dissociate rate in
   the membrane. The reduction of silver ions contained in
   cation-exchangers in a molar fraction of 80% with sodium borohydride
   affords a conducting metal silver film on their surfaces. The
   introduction of silver nanoparticles into the MA-40 anionexchange
   membrane is accompanied by the increase in both the limiting
   electrodiffusion current and the water dissociation rate in the
   membrane, which is apparently due to the partial oxidation of metal
   silver particles to afford silver oxide in the near-surface membrane
   layer. The latter oxide exhibits weak catalytic activity with respect
   to water dissociation reaction in the membrane, which results in an
   insignificant increase in the effective transport numbers of hydroxide
   ions through the membrane.

   the choice of the classical potential considerably affects dynamic
   characteristics of graphene-based systems. The calculated low values of
   the Q-factor for these vibrations Q approximate to 10-100 show that
   graphene should be perfect for the use in fast-responding nanorelays
   and nanoelectromechanical memory cells.

TI Visualizing Interfacial Charge Transfer in Ru-Dye-Sensitized TiO2
   Nanoparticles Using X-ray Transient Absorption Spectroscopy
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
ID SOLAR-CELL APPLICATIONS; MOLECULAR-STRUCTURE; ELECTRON INJECTION; XANES
AB A molecular level understanding of the structural reorganization
   accompanying interfacial electron transfer is important for rational
   design of solar cells. Here we have applied XTA (X-ray transient
   absorption) spectroscopy to study transient structures in a
   heterogeneous interfacial system mimicking the charge separation
   process in dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) with Ru(dcbpy)(2)(NCS)(2)
   (RuN3) dye adsorbed to TiO2 nanopartide surfaces. The results show that
   the average Ru-NCS bond length reduces by 0.06 angstrom, whereas the
   average Ru-N(dcbpy) bond length remains nearly unchanged after the
   electron injection. The differences in bond-order change and steric
   hindrance between two types of ligands are attributed to their
   structural response in the charge separation. This study extends the
   application of XTA into optically opaque hybrid interfacial systems
   relevant to the solar energy conversion.

AB Small (3-5 nm in diameter following HRTEM images) Si nanocrystals were
   produced in a two-stage process including (1) nanosecond laser ablation
   of a Si target in an organic liquid (chloroform) that results in
   formation of big composite polycrystalline particles (about 20-100 nm
   average diameter) and (2) ultrasonic post-treatment of Si nanoparticles
   in the presence of HP. The post-treatment is responsible for
   disintegration of the composite Si particles, release of small
   individual nanocrystals, and reduction of their size due to HF-induced
   etching of Si oxide. The downshift and broadening of the similar to S20
   cm(-1) Raman phonon band of the small Si nanocrystals with respect to
   the bulk Si Raman band is consistent with the presence of similar to
   4.5 nm Si nanocrystals. The photoluminescence spectra (450-900 nm) and
   decay kinetics of small Si nanocrystals were detected, and the possible
   origin of the luminescence is discussed.

AB Aqueous suspensions of 10 nm, 50 nm, or 1 mu m Fe3O4 particles were
   injected intraperitoneally (ip) to rats at a dose of 500 mg/kg in 4 mL
   of sterile deionized water 3 times a week for 5 weeks. Following
   exposure, functional and biochemical indices and histopathological
   examinations of spleen and liver tissues of exposed rats were evaluated
   for signs of toxicity. The iron content of the blood was measured
   photometrically, and that of the liver and the spleen by atomic
   adsorption spectroscopy (AAS) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)
   methods. It was found that, given equal mass doses, Fe3O4 nanoparticles
   possess considerably higher systemic toxicity than microparticles, but
   within the nanometric range the relationship between particle size and
   resorptive toxicity is intricate and nonunique. The latter fact may be
   attributed to differences in different nanoparticles' toxicokinetics,
   which are controlled by both more or less substantial direct
   penetration of nanoparticles through biological barriers and their
   unequal solubility.

TI Preparation of Nickel Nanoparticles for Catalytic Applications
SO INORGANIC MATERIALS
LA English
DT Article
AB Spherical oxidized nickel particles 15 to 200 nm in average size have
   been produced by a crucible-less aerosol method involving metal vapor
   condensation in an inert gas flow and oxidation processes. The
   particles have been characterized by scanning electron microscopy,
   X-ray microanalysis, X-ray diffraction, BET surface area measurements,
   and vibrating-sample magnetometry. The process parameters have been
   optimized for the preparation of particles with tailored size, specific
   surface area, and saturation magnetization. A dc electric field applied
   to the condensation zone during the oxidation process reduces the size
   and increases the extent of oxidation of the particles. We have studied
   low-temperature oxidation of carbon monoxide and propane on nickel
   nanopowders differing in particle size and extent of oxidation. The
   nanoparticles with optimized characteristics have been shown to have a
   marked catalytic effect on these processes.

SO INORGANIC MATERIALS
LA English
DT Article
AB We have studied the effect of grinding in planetary mills on the phase
   composition, morphology, and water content of hydroxyapatite powder.
   The results indicate that milling for even relatively short times,
   which reduces the average particle size by a factor of 2, causes the
   monetite present in the unmilled powder to disappear and reduces the
   crystallite size of the hydroxyapatite. The fraction of nanoparticles
   in the powder is then 98% and remains constant during further milling.
   Milling for longer times leads to hydroxyapatite amorphization. For an
   average size of large particles R >= 1 mu m, the surface area of the
   particles per unit volume, E (cm(-1)), is determined only by R (E
   similar to 1/R).

   protein-dextran sulfate insoluble complex. The following properties of
   polyelectrolyte hormone-containing microparticles were studied: pH
   stability, surface charge, mucoadhesive properties, Ca2+ binding,
   degradation under the influence of proteases (trypsin, chymotrypsin).
   The influence of the self-association ability of encapsulated insulins
   on the form of protein releasing from microparticles was studied.
   Insulins aspart and lispro released from the microparticles as monomers
   were more liable to proteolysis than human insulin released as a
   hexamer. The combined effect of properties of polyelectrolyte
   microparticles and of encapsulated recombinant proteins on the
   bioavailability of insulin under peroral administration is discussed.

AB The reaction of the hydrogenation of a mixture of carbon oxides on

   and their bimetallic mechanical mixtures was investigated. It was
   established that the main reaction product on UDP Ni is methane, while
   the main products on the bimetallic systems are methane and ethylene. A
   synergetic effect was observed on the bimetallic catalyst under
   investigation. It was revealed that the hydrogenation of a mixture of
   carbon oxides proceeds through the stage of dissociative adsorption of
   both components, CO and CO2. The olefin selectivity of the process was
   explained by the participation of different forms of adsorbed hydrogen
   (H-I : H-II) at the catalyst surface. It is assumed that the
   hydrogenation of carbon oxides on iron-nickel catalysts proceeds either
   through the jumpover effect or via hydrogen spillover.

   found that fixed PAH molecules are capable of acting as electronic

   dilute PAH solutions (5 x 10(-10)-1 x 10(-6) g/ml) in the presence of
   silver nanoparticles (similar to 0.7 vol %) that the concentration of
   PAH molecules from solutions occurs due to its sorption on hydrocarbon
   CTAB radicals in close contact to the surface of metallic silver. On
   the basis of the spectral data, the sorption isotherms were obtained
   and the values of extraction degree and partition coefficients for
   naphthalene, phenanthrene, anthracene, chrysene, pyrene, and
   3,4-benzopyrene were calculated. It was found that the degree of
   extraction values of the investigated PAHs fall within the range of
   73-98%, the partition coefficients (logD) similar to 6, and the
   concentration coefficients similar to 10(5).

AB We study numerically the photon input efficiency of silicon solar cells
   due to gold plasmonic nanoparticles deposited on the cells. At low
   densities, when collective effects in light scattering by the
   nanoparticle ensemble are negligible, the absorption dependence
   increases linearly for a significant range of the solar spectrum.
   Collective effects lead to the input efficiency saturates, reaches its
   maximum and then decreases with nanoparticle density. The maximal input
   efficiency depends on the photon wavelength, nanoparticle shape and
   size, their distance to the cell, and the cell thickness, and can reach
   similar to 95% in thick solar cells. Finally, we show that aluminum

AB We present the synthesis and characterization of spherical
   polyelectrolyte brush (SPB) particles carrying zwitterionic
   polyelectrolyte chains. The colloidal particles consist of a
   divinylbenzene cross-linked poly(styrene) core (PS-co-DVB core) of
   about 100 nm in diameter onto which linear zwitterionic
   poly(2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl dimethyl-(3-sulfopropyl)-ammonium
   hydroxide) (pMEDSAH) chains are chemically grafted via ATRP.
   zeta-Potential measurements demonstrated that the SPB has an
   electrophoretic mobility due to the net charge of the PS-co-DVB core
   particles. There is an increase of the brush thickness L of the
   zwitterionic brush at high concentrations of sodium chloride at room
   temperature. Temperature-dependent measurements by dynamic light
   scattering (DLS) showed that the zwitterionic SPBs swell reversibly
   with increasing temperature because of the upper critical solution
   temperature (UCST) of the pMEDSAH chains in water. This effect could be
   enhanced by the addition of salt. Cryogenic transmission electron
   microscopy (cryoTEM) showed that the shell of the particles is quite
   compact at room temperature. However, the hydrodynamic radius as
   measured by DLS was significantly larger than the particles radius
   inferred from microscopy. This result is explained in terms of a model
   in which the shell of the zwitterionic SPB undergoes a phase separation
   into a dense phase and a few chains sticking out into the aqueous phase.

ID INACTIVATED INFLUENZA VACCINES
AB The use of inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine is very important for
   eradicating poliomyelitis. However, this vaccine is not available
   readily in underdeveloped countries due to the high cost. Adjuvants can
   improve the immunogenicity of a vaccine and reduce the antigen dose
   required for vaccination, thus lowering the cost of the vaccine.
   Chitosan glutamate solution and a chitosan sulfate micro/nanoparticle
   suspension were tested as adjuvants for Imovax-inactivated poliovaccine
   and for inactivated monovalent poliovirus type 1, 2, and 3 vaccines
   obtained by inactivation of the attenuated Sabin poliovirus strains.
   Inactivated vaccines admixed with either chitosan glutamate or chitosan
   sulfate micro/nanoparticles and administered to mice showed
   significantly enhanced immunogenicity to poliovirus type 1, 2, and 3
   strains compared to the respective vaccines administered without
   chitosan. Chitosan preparations increased the immunogenicity of 1:2 and
   1:4 diluted inactivated Sabin strain preparations in mice 8- to
   16-fold, so that the neutralizing antibody titers after vaccination
   with adjuvanted diluted vaccine were equal to those obtained after
   vaccination with undiluted vaccine administered without chitosan.
   Neutralizing antibodies could be detected in sera of rats vaccinated
   with undiluted, 1:10, and 1:100 diluted Imovax vaccine admixed with
   chitosan sulfate micro/nanoparticles, although in the control group,
   vaccination only with the undiluted vaccine resulted in antibody
   production. These results show that the chitosan glutamate solution and
   chitosan sulfate micro/nanoparticle suspension can significantly
   improve the immunogenicity of various poliovaccines, and reduce the
   effective antigen dose. J. Med. Virol. 83:847-852, 2011. (C) 2011

AB The effect of various nanofillers (nanofibers of Al2O3 and carbon,
   nanopowders of copper and SiO2) on the physico-mechanical and
   tribotechnical properties of superhigh-molecular polyethylene is
   investigated. It is determined that the modification of
   superhigh-molecular polyethylene by nanofibers and nanoparticles within
   the limits of 0.1-05 wt % results in a substantial rise in its
   deformation-strength characteristics and a multifold increase in its
   tribotechnical characteristics. By the methods of X-ray structure
   analysis, infrared spectroscopy, and electron microscopy, it is shown
   that modification of the polymer by the mentioned nanofillers results
   in the formation of an ordered (lamellar) permolecular structure. It is
   revealed that nanofibers form a stable film of friction transfer more
   quickly in comparison with nanoparticles. The optimum compositions of
   nanofillers, which determine the high wear resistance and the low
   constant of friction for polymer, are determined. The mechanical
   activation of the binder and filler powders provides a uniform
   distribution of the nanopowder within the binder and additionally

AB The energetics of electrons at the surface of a nanostructured
   semiconductor in contact with an electrolyte are analyzed in this
   paper. The solvation of electrons produces a gap in the density of
   states, which separates the occupied states from empty states by
   solvation energy. The dynamic effects of the solvation, with respect to
   the relaxation time of the electrolyte, are discussed. A calculation by
   random-walk numerical simulation of the diffusion coefficient of
   electrons moving in the surface of nanoparticles shows the reduction of
   the rate of transport by the polarization effect.

AB X-ray photoelectron and Mossbauer spectroscopy were used to study the
   composition and structure of Fe-57-Pd bimetallic black and
   Fe-57-Pd/SiO2 nanocomposites prepared by metal-vapor synthesis. The
   main parameters of the core level photoelectron spectra of Fe-57-Pd
   systems were determined. The bimetallic system was shown to be a
   disordered amorphous structure consisting of Pd particles,
   superparamagnetic gamma-Fe2O3 nanoparticles with size 8-10 nm, and a
   Fe-O-Pd solid solution. Considerable broadening of Pd 3d peaks in
   Fe-57-Pd/SiO2 and an increase in the O 1s-Si 2p energy interval by 0.4
   eV with respect to the spectrum of initial SiO2 were observed; this was
   evidence of the interaction of Pd with the support. The binding energy
   of Fe 2p (3/2) peak in the nanocomposite spectrum was close to that of
   Fe2O3, but had a smaller width of the satellite peak and a larger
   spin-orbit splitting, which was indicative of a considerable amount of
   FeOOH on the surface compared with the other iron oxides.

AB A general thermodynamic approach is presented towards a triple point
   shift in arbitrary spatially limited systems with a curvilinear
   interface, including interfacial phases, small particles, and matter in
   pores. The suggested approach is based on using the coupling equations
   for vapor pressure over the bulk and spatially limited media together
   with the Clausius-Clapeyron relationships, and allows one to explain
   the effect of different physical-chemical parameters on the value and
   sign of the shift in the phase transition temperature. Besides, an
   explanation was offered within the developed theory for the difference
   in the melting points of different crystal faces, the presence of a
   nanometer melt layer for the substance in fine pores, and the formation
   of premolten or presolidified shell about nanoparticles.

   accelerated durability testing in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution either using

   dissolution of Pd and Co components is shown to result in a
   restructuring of the catalyst surface and the formation of a core-shell
   Pt/PdCoPt/C structure with higher catalytic activity and stability
   compared to a Pt/C system. The results of experiments with a rotating

   reduction after the chemical and electrochemical treatment of the

TI Nucleation kinetics in a CuCl solid solution in glass: Calculation and
   comparison with experiment
SO PHYSICS OF THE SOLID STATE
LA English
DT Article
ID GROWTH
AB The kinetics of formation of CuCl nanoparticles in a glass has been
   studied. The experimental results obtained have been compared with the
   results of calculations. A method has been developed for calculating
   the nucleation kinetics, which decreases the time of calculations by a
   factor of several tens. This has been achieved using the joint kinetic
   equation for distributions of clusters over the number of particles and
   over the radius. The distributions over the number of particles and
   over the radius have been used for small and large clusters,
   respectively. The concentration of molecules near the surface of
   clusters has been determined from the asymptotic solution of the
   diffusion equation. For subcritical clusters, the concentration of
   molecules near the cluster surface has been taken to be equal to the
   average concentration in the solid solution. This method has been used
   to calculate the nucleation kinetics of CuCl nanoparticles in a glass.
   The results obtained from the calculation of the time dependences of
   the increase in the concentration and average radius of clusters agree
   well with experiment.

ID ROOM-TEMPERATURE FERROMAGNETISM; SEMICONDUCTORS; OXIDE
AB This paper reports on the results of the calculation of the depth
   distribution profiles of the concentration of the impurity implanted
   into an anisotropic crystalline material. The sputtering of the
   irradiated material, fast one-dimensional diffusion of the impurity
   along structural channels, and accumulation of the implanted impurity
   at different depths have been taken into account. The results of the
   calculations have been compared with the experimental distribution
   profiles of cobalt ions implanted into the crystal structure of rutile
   TiO2 along and across structural channels at different temperatures of
   the irradiated substrate. A comparison of the model and experimental
   profiles has made it possible to evaluate the precipitation rate of
   cobalt in the TiO2 matrix on different precipitation centers. A model
   has been proposed for explaining the unusual shift in the peak of the
   concentration distribution of implanted ions deep into the sample with
   an increase in the temperature of the irradiated substrate. The model
   has allowed one to separate the contributions from different phases of
   the impurity (nanoparticles and solid solution) to the magnetism of the
   Co: TiO2 system.

AB The recent experimental results on the acceleration of alpha decay
   under laser exposure of metallic nanoparticles in aqueous solutions
   (D2O or H2O) of uranium salt UO2Cl2 are reviewed. It is demonstrated
   that the rate of the alpha decay of uranium branching depends on the
   laser wavelength and laser peak power both under exposure of the
   solution of uranium salt in colloidal solutions of metallic
   nanoparticles and under laser ablation of a bulk target in an aqueous
   solution. Tuning the laser wavelength to the plasmon resonance allows
   observation of large deviations of the contents of radio-nuclides of
   U-238 branching from their equilibrium values. The effect of laser
   exposure is characterized by high isotopic selectivity towards the
   decay of different nuclides. Possible mechanisms of the laser-induced
   alpha decay of uranium isotopes and their potential applications are
   discussed.

AB We study the sensitization of fluorescence of Nile red in nanoparticles
   formed in aqueous solutions of complexes of Al, In, Sc, and Lu with
   DBM, DBM, and phen and of complexes of In with MBTA and phen. We show
   that, at concentrations of Nile red of 2-50 nM and complexes of 10-30
   mu M, the fluorescence intensity of Nile red in aqueous solutions
   increases by 1.5-2 orders of magnitude compared to its fluorescence in
   H2O. We find that, at these concentrations of Nile red in solutions of
   complexes Al, the dye is completely contained in nanoparticles from
   these complexes. We show that Nile red molecules are inhomogeneously
   distributed in nanoparticles from complexes and, upon the completion of
   the formation of nanoparticles, dye molecules tend to be localized in
   regions of nanoparticles formed from diketonate complexes
   M(diketone)(3)phen (M is Lu or In) and Al(DBM)(3). Upon the
   localization of Nile red in these regions, the maximum of its
   fluorescence spectrum shifts toward similar to 600 nm and, upon the
   penetration of Nile red into nanoparticles from Sc complexes, the shift
   of the maximum of its fluorescence spectrum compared to the spectrum in
   water does not exceed 10 nm. The shifts of the spectra are collated
   with the ability of ions to form diketonate and hydroxy diketonate
   complexes. We demonstrate that the fluorescence of Nile red is
   efficiently sensitized, not only upon its penetration into
   nanoparticles formed from complexes, but also upon its adsorption on
   the nanoparticle surface when Nile red molecules are introduced in
   solutions of already formed nanoparticles.

   time to a few hours and, with higher concentrations of
   p-phenylenediamine even to tens of minutes Nonconducting aniline
   oligomers, however, are also present in the oxidation products as a
   rule The chemistry of individual oxidation pathways is discussed Higher
   concentrations of p phenylenediamine in the reaction mixture with
   aniline give rise to copolymers poly[aniline-co (p-phenylenechamine)]s
   and their composites with metallic silver p-Phenylenediamine alone can
   similarly be oxidized with silver nitrate to poly(p phenylenediamine)
   composite with silver Silver is present in the composites both as
   nanoparticles of similar to 50 nm size and as larger objects The
   composites have conductivity in the range of the order of 10(-3)-10(3)
   S cm(-1) at comparable content of silver, which was close to the
   theoretical expectation, 68 9 wt % The composites prepared in 1 M
   acetic acid always have a higher conductivity compared with those
   resulting from synthesis in 1 M nitric acid The polymerizations of
   aniline accelerated with 1 mol % of p-phenylenediamine in 1 M acetic
   acid yield a composite of the highest conductivity 6100 S cm(-1) At
   higher contents of p phenylenediamine,
   poly[aniline-co-(p-phenylenediamine)] composites with silver have a
   conductivity lower by several orders of magnitude The oxidation of p
   phenylenediamine alone with silver nitrate in 1 M acetic acid also
   yields a conducting composite, its conductivity being 1750 S cm(-1) The
   semiconductor type of conductivity in polymers and the metallic type of
   conductivity in silver may compensate to yield composites with
   conductivity nearly independent of temperature over a broad temperature
   range

AB We demonstrate the functioning of a macromolecular nanoreactor which
   guides a reaction in a confined volume and leads toward improved
   functional properties of a product material. In our approach, the
   polymerization of aniline (ANi) is conducted within the interfacial
   volume of spherical polyelectrolyte brushes (SPB) which are densely
   affixed to colloidal particles. The SPB provide optimal conditions for
   matrix polymerization by the efficient confinement of ANi monomers
   within the finite volume of polyelectrolyte brushes and controlled
   delivery of the oxidizing reagent to the reaction volume. The excellent
   kinetic stability of the resulting core-shell particles together with
   the high macroscopic conductivity of the respective composite open up
   perspectives for novel materials (a conductive ink).

ID NANOPARTICLES
AB Dense thin nanostructured films of cadmium sulfide CdS obtained by
   chemical deposition from aqueous solutions are strongly bound to a
   substrate due to the formation of cadmium hydroxide Cd(OH)(2) in the
   system. By X-ray reflectometry and grazing incidence diffraction it is
   found that at the beginning of the deposition a dense Cd(OH)(2)/SiO2
   layer is produced on the surface of a silicon or glass substrate. This
   layer is formed through the atomic-layer adsorption of crystalline 1-3
   nm thick Cd(OH)(2) film by the oxygen-containing substrate surface.
   During sulfidation of this cadmium-containing substrate layer, a
   surface nucleation layer of CdS/Cd(OH)(2)/SiO2 forms, which provides
   the growth, denseness, and strong adhesion to the substrate of
   nanostructured CdS film with a disordered structure. According to the
   obtained experimental data, a "hydroxide scheme" of film deposition is
   confirmed and refined, and the stages of CdS nanofilm formation are
   determined.

ID NANODIAMONDS; NANOCRYSTALS; NMR
AB We report on a H-1 NMR study of diamond nanoparticles decorated by
   copper and cobalt. Increase in the H-1 relaxation rate under decoration
   results from the interactions of hydrogen nuclear spins of the surface
   hydrocarbon and hydroxyl groups with paramagnetic copper and cobalt
   ions. This finding reveals the appearance of paramagnetic Cu2+ or Co2+
   ions on the detonation nanodiamond (DND) surface rather than as a
   separate phase, which is consistent with the C-13 NMR data of the same
   samples. Our results shed light on the mechanism of ion incorporation.
   A topological model for relative position of paramagnetic Cu2+ or Co2+
   ions and hydrogen atoms on the DND surface is suggested. An application
   of the studied nanomaterials in the field of biomedicine is discussed.

ID MAGNETIC NANOPARTICLES; FABRICATION
AB Interaction of cobalt ferrite nanopowder and nucleic acid was
   investigated. Superparamagnetic cobalt ferrite nanoparticles (6-12 nm)
   were prepared by mechanochemical synthesis. Structure of the nanopowder
   was characterized using X-ray diffraction. It was shown that cobalt
   ferrite nanoparticles were associated with ssDNA and dsDNA in
   Tris-buffer resulting in bionanocomposite formation with mass weight
   relation nanoparticles: DNA 1:(0.083 +/- 0.003) and 1:(0.075 +/- 0.003)
   respectively. The mechanism of interaction between a DNA and cobalt
   ferrite nanoparticles was considered basing on the whole set of
   obtained data: FTIR-spectroscopy, analyzing desorption of DNA from the
   surface of the particles while changing the chemical content of the
   medium, and on the modeling interaction of specific biomolecule
   fragments with surface of a inorganic material. It was supposed that
   the linkage was based on coordination interaction of the phosphate
   groups and oxygen atoms heterocyclic bases of DNA with metal ions on
   the particle surface. These data can be used to design specific
   magnetic DNA-nanoparticles hybrid structures.

   quantum dynamics of atoms, quantum entanglement dynamics of nanosystems
   and classical dynamics of micropour systems. They obey the principals
   of self-assembling and self-organization on the level of nanosystems,
   that is the most basic one for self-managing operations. It demands the

AB Silver/polyacrylonitrile (Ag/PAN) nanocomposites are synthesized at the
   stage of simultaneous acrylonitrile polymerization and the reduction of
   silver ions from a mixture of silver nitrate AgNO3, acrylonitrile, and
   a photoinitiator. The synthesized films are transparent in the visible
   region and are characterized by a uniform dispersion of silver
   nanoparticles in a PAN matrix without any macroscopic agglomeration.
   The effects of the metal salt and photoinitiator concentrations on the
   size and density of metal nanoparticles in a composite are revealed.

AB TiO2 nanopowder is produced by the low-temperature hydrolysis of TiCl4.
   The phase composition of the sample is found to form at a hydrolysis
   temperature of 30-38A degrees C. Low-temperature annealing (up to 440A
   degrees C) increases the degree of crystallinity of the phases present
   in the sample (anatase, brookite) and only weakly affects their ratio.
   At 500A degrees C, the sample consists of three phases: rutile is
   detected apart from anatase and brookite. Brookite begins to fail at
   600A degrees C; at 700A degrees C, crystalline brookite fails
   completely.

AB We demonstrate a new one-batch approach to the fabrication of a
   biocompatible Ca-alginate film with embedded vitamin E-loaded
   microspheres that could be used for planar dermal drug delivery. Stable
   vitamin E microspheres, coated with gum acacia, are produced by
   ultrasonic treatment of a two-phase liquid system. The Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy indicates an interaction between
   biopolymer functional groups induced by ultrasonication. Confocal laser
   fluorescence microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic
   force microscopy (AFM) demonstrate a homogeneous microsphere
   distribution within the Ca-alginate polymer film. The kinetics of in
   vitro vitamin E release found for the polymer film with entrapped
   microspheres was much more sustained (100% in 96 h) compared to the
   polymer film with vitamin E embedded in the free state (100% in 5 h).
   The novelty of the proposed research involves the ultrasonic
   fabrication of loaded microspheres and formation of biodegradable
   coating directly doped with microspheres.

AB The technique of preparing nonstoichiometric polyelectrolyte complexes
   of chitosan soluble in neutral solutions is developed. Chitosan
   complexes soluble in neutral solutions and meeting the behavioral
   criteria of water-soluble nonstoichiometric polyelectrolyte complexes
   are prepared via mixing of strongly acidic solutions of chitosan and
   polystyrenesulfonate anions taken in a nonequimolar charge-charge ratio
   and subsequent neutralization of the products by a solution of alkali.
   Thus, the region of existence of soluble complexes narrows with a
   decrease in the length of the host polyanion up to its full
   degeneration in the case of oligomeric anions. The critical
   concentration of a salt that brings about phase separation decreases
   with an increase in the relative content of the guest chitosan in a
   mixture and depends on the ratio of chain lengths of polymer
   components. DOI: 10.1134/S0965545X10040048

AB The K X-ray absorption near-edge fine structure spectra of metallic Cu,
   Ni, Co (hexagonal close-packed and face-centered cubic phases), and Cr
   have been studied. The experimental spectrum of cobalt has been
   measured in the high-temperature face-centered cubic phase. The
   calculations have been performed by the full multiple scattering method
   in the cluster approximation using the semiempirical muffin-tin
   potential. The spectra have been calculated for clusters containing
   from 13 to 935 atoms. It has been demonstrated that the spectra cease
   to depend on the cluster size for clusters containing about 400 atoms.
   It has been established that the intensity ratio of two peaks located
   at the fundamental edge of all the spectra under investigation sharply
   changes with a variation in the atomic potential strength. The
   mechanisms responsible for the formation of the near-edge structure of
   the spectra have been revealed using the results of the model
   calculations. The studies resulted in good agreement of the calculated
   spectra with the experiment.

AB Medium power (0.3-8.0 W) 970 nm in wavelength laser irradiation of
   water with added Ag nanoparticles (in the form of Ag-albumin complexes)
   through 400 mu m optical fiber stimulates self-organization of
   filaments of Ag nanoparticles for a few minutes. These filaments
   represent themselves long (up to 14 cm) liquid gradient fibers with
   unexpectedly thin (10-80 mu m) core diameter. They are stable in the
   course of laser irradiation being destroyed after laser radiation off.
   Such effect of filaments of Ag nanoparticles self-organization is
   rationalized by the peculiarities of laser-induced hydrodynamic
   processes developed in water in presence of laser light and by
   formation of liquid fibers.

AB Pt/carbon black samples fabricated from dimethyl (1,5-cyclooctadiene)
   platinum(II) in supercritical CO2 are characterized in relation to
   possible applications in methanol fuel cell. The problem of precise
   material characterization is addressed in frames of X-ray
   diffractometry, transmission electron microscopy, and electrochemical
   techniques of the true surface area determination. The catalysts with
   Pt loading of 20-40 wt.% consist of nm-size particles, with the lattice
   defectiveness dependent on the fabrication mode. To check the effect of
   support, various types of carbon blacks (Vulcan XC72R and acetylene
   black AC-1) are used. In contrast to commercial HiSpec catalysts, no
   pronounced increase of particle size with Pt loading is found. Specific
   steady-state activity towards methanol oxidation appears to be
   essentially higher than for commercial catalysts, mostly because the
   self-poisoning effects are less pronounced. As for poisoning of Pt with
   organic species (resulting from the ligand of precursor), its effects
   are demonstrated to be minor after CO or methanol adsorption
   accompanied by desorption of contaminating by-product.

DE Magnetic fluid; Stabilizer; Polypropylene glycol
AB A series of samples of magnetic fluids stabilized with low-molecular
   weight polypropylene glycol (PPG) of different molecular masses were
   synthesized. The use of PPG allowed the maximum extension of the
   carrier fluid range to include ethyl- and butyl-acetate, ethanol,
   butanol, acetone, carbon tetrachloride, toluene, kerosene and PPG
   itself. Magnetic and rheological properties of the samples were
   investigated. Based on the results of investigation it has been
   concluded that magnetic nanoparticles are covered by a monolayer of
   surfactant molecules. At low temperatures the propanol-based sample
   preserves fluidity upto -115 degrees C. Measurement of critical
   temperatures of other base fluids showed that alcohols are the best
   carrier medium. Coagulation stability of the ethanol-based ferrocolloid
   with respect to water and kerosene was explored. It has been found that
   kerosene, whose fraction by weight exceeds 22.5%, does not mix with the
   colloid. This effect can be used to produce magneto-controllable
   extractors of ethyl alcohol. Under the action of water the colloid
   coagulates, which allows one to substitute the carrier fluid and to
   separate the colloid into fractions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

DE Ferrofluid; Rheology; Slow relaxation; Iron cluster; Stress overshoot
ID SUSPENSIONS
AB Rheological experiments on relaxation of shear stress in a diluted
   ferrofluid with clustered iron oxide nanoparticles (phi=0.1 vol%) have
   been performed. Changes of the stress appearing in the fluid at
   constant magnetic field strength after a stepwise change of shear rate
   gamma have been measured. It has been found that the time of the
   transient, until the shear stress in the fluid will be steady, depends
   strongly on the strength of the applied magnetic field and shear rate.
   For vanishing magnetic field slow relaxation has not been observed. The
   time of the transient in the presence of a magnetic field can reach
   several minutes. The change of the transient viscosity eta(t=1/gamma)
   (gamma) as a function of the steady viscosity eta(t ->infinity) (gamma)
   shows a linear behavior and depends on magnetic field strength. Those
   effects can be attributed to the process of structure formation and
   destruction due to the simultaneous action of an applied magnetic field
   and shear flow. A similar behavior is known from the rheology of
   complex fluids like polymer melts or aggregating colloids. We propose a
   model of the rheological effects based on the assumption that the
   clusters form linear chains which size distribution is determined by
   applied magnetic field and shear rate. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

DE Ferromagnetic glass; Amorphous monodisperse nanoparticles; Magnetic
   properties of nanoparticles
ID RANDOM ANISOTROPY
AB We have studied theoretically (including computer simulations) magnetic
   properties of aggregates of ferromagnetic amorphous nanogranules in the
   presence of direct exchange between the neighboring granules and random
   anisotropy fields. We show that such a system can be considered as
   ferromagnetic glass. We demonstrate (basing on analytical
   considerations as well as on the results of numerical simulations) that
   the system is decomposed to clusters or domains with nearly collinear
   orientation of magnetization. The size of the domains depends on the
   ratio of the exchange interaction and random anisotropy. For quasi-2D
   structures we predict that the dipole-dipole interactions between the
   granules lead to a formation of magnetic vortices. Moreover, the
   computer simulations also reproduce the puzzling increase of the
   thermoremanent magnetization observed experimentally, which is expected
   to be a result of a temperature-dependent decrease in the anisotropy
   (or a temperature-dependent increase in the exchange). We also consider
   the structures with weak intergranular exchange and show that they are
   characterized by the presence of two critical temperatures. (C) 2011

AB The thermal atomic vibration spectrum of lead nanostructured in porous
   glass with an average pore size of 7 nm and the thermal vibration
   spectrum of conventional bulk lead (taken for comparison) are measured
   using inelastic neutron scattering. The density of states in the phonon
   spectrum of lead nanoparticles is found to exceed the density of states
   in the spectrum of bulk lead at both low (E < 2.5 meV) and high (E >
   9.5 meV) energies. These data are used to propose a model for the
   structure of a porous glass-lead nano-composite.

AB A theory of conductivity is developed for metal-containing
   nanocomposites. An expression is obtained for the tunneling rate of an
   electron between nanoparticles. Three regimes of current flow are
   possible: the cases of weak, strong, and superstrong electric fields.
   In the weak-field regime, the electrons generated as a result of
   ionization of neutral nanoparticles are characterized by a nearly
   equilibrium distribution. The conductivity in this regime is calculated
   with the use of this nearly equilibrium distribution of electrons and
   the relationship between the spacing of neighboring particles and their
   radii. An expression is obtained for the electric conductivity as a
   function of temperature and a magnetic field (for ferromagnets) with
   regard to the distribution of nanoparticles with respect to radius and
   their volume density.

DT Article
ID SURFACE STRESS; HIGH-PRESSURE; NANOCRYSTALS; PHASE; THERMODYNAMICS;
   ENERGY; PB
AB The Mie-Gruneisen equation is adapted for the description of the
   thermodynamic properties of nano-objects. It is shown that the
   Gruneisen parameter Gamma depends on the ratio of the number of surface
   atoms to the number of interior atoms of the nano-objects. This ratio
   is determined by the characteristic size of nano-object and its form.
   It increases with decrease of the characteristic size. Reduction of the
   characteristic size of nano-objects that have a free surface, leads to
   a change in the Gruneisen parameter. If the nano-object is embedded in
   a matrix and has with it the coherent boundary, at the decrease of the
   nano-object size occurs either an increase or decrease of Gamma.
   Compression or stretching of nano-objects may bring about a change of
   the ratio between numbers of the interior and surface atoms caused by
   changing the form of nano-objects. The change of the Gruneisen
   parameter at the characteristic size decreasing of a nano-object is
   treated as the change of a degree of the anharmonicity of lattice
   thermal vibrations. It is established that an appreciable change of
   Gamma occurs if the characteristic radius of a nano-object is less than
   5 nm.

AB Gas-phase photocatalytic oxidation of organophosphorous compound
   dimethyl methylphosphonate was carried out in a flow reactor on
   platinized TiO2 Degussa P25. Platinization was performed by soft
   chemical reduction (SCR) and photodeposition (PD) techniques.
   Dispersion and chemical state of platinum were studied by X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and high-resolution transmission
   electron microscopy (HRTEM). It was found that SCR gave mostly metallic
   platinum, whereas PD gave only Pt2+ form. During the oxidation, the
   state of platinum on a SCR catalyst remained unchanged, which
   determined its good stability. The catalyst with PD platinum
   deactivated quite fast due to aggregation of Pt particles. The SCR
   technique was found to provide better stability and activity. (C) 2010

AB We examine the issue of whether a low-volume fraction of nano-and
   microparticles can lead to phase separation in semidilute biopolymer
   mixtures. To this end, we determine the phase diagrams and ESEM images
   of aqueous semidilute and weakly structured sodium caseinate-sodium
   alginate-dextran sulfate (SC-SA-DS) systems in the presence of several
   charged micro particles with a diameter less, higher, and comparable
   with the size of the system network holes (2-3 mm). We demonstrate that
   3 mu m particles (both negatively and positively charged) help to
   enhance phase separation, and increase the viscoelastic properties of
   the emulsion, whereas the larger particles affect oppositely, and
   nanoparticles (210 nm and 910 nm in diameter) do not affect appreciably
   the phase separation and rheology. Experimental observations suggest
   that the dominant mechanism responsible for the decreased thermodynamic
   compatibility in such systems may be the formation of the large charged
   microparticle (3 mu m)-SC/DSS associates in SC enriched phase that
   leads to decrease their compatibility with alginate due to the effect
   of the excluded volume interactions between SA and microparticle-DS +
   SC associates. Decrease in compatibility and increase in
   viscoelastisity are more pronounced by using highly charged hydrophobic
   carboxylate modified sulfonate latex (CLM sulfonate) and sulfate latex,
   and, to a lesser estend by use of aliphatic amino latex, and
   hydrophilic CLM latex.

   with the formation of (AlOOH) (n) and (Al2O3) (n) nanoparticles. The
   release of H-2 began at 523 K when the reagents were heated uniformly

   supercritical water was injected into a reactor with aluminum samples
   at 665 K and 23.1 MPa. Oxidized aluminum powders were analyzed using a
   transmission electron microscope. Predominantly large (300-400 nm)
   alpha-Al2O3 particles were formed when supercritical water was injected
   into a reactor with aluminum. Smaller (20-50 nm) gamma-Al2O3 particles
   were also observed in samples oxidized by water vapor under temperature
   increase conditions. Kinetic equations describing the rate of H-2
   formation in the reaction of H2O with aluminum were obtained. Possible

AB With the use of supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2), the matrix
   immobilization of photoluminescent silicon nanocrystals (nc-Si) in
   polytetrafluoroethylene microparticles (mp-PTFE) is performed, which
   leads to the formation of mp-PTFE/nc-Si photoluminescent nanocomposite
   containing similar to 10(3)-10(4) nc-Si particles per mp-PTFE particle
   (1-2 mu m in size). This approach is based on the effect of polymer
   swelling in SC-CO2, efficient SC-CO2-assisted transport of
   nanoparticles into the internal free volume of the polymer, and
   contraction of the nanocomposite after the release of CO2, an effect
   that prevents the subsequent agglutination of nanoparticles. Particles
   of nc-Si photoluminescent in the visible spectrum were synthesized from
   silicon suboxide powder (SiO (x) , x a parts per thousand 1) heated at
   various temperatures within 25-950A degrees C and then etched in
   concentrated hydrofluoric acid. The hydrosilylation procedure was used
   to graft 1-octadecene molecules to the surface of nc-Si particles. As a
   result, the photoluminescence intensity of nc-Si increased
   substantially. According to TEM images and small angle X-ray scattering
   data, the maximum size of nc-Si particles did not exceed 5 nm and 7 nm,
   respectively, and the core of these nanoparticles consisted of
   crystalline silicon. The structure and spectral properties of the
   initial nc-Si particles and synthesized mp-PTFE/nc-Si photoluminescent
   nanocomposite microparticles were studied.

   blood plasma proteins at physiological pH 7.4 is found weaker than that

   transformations of the adsorbed protein. Using the lysozyme as a test
   protein we show that the protein adsorption leading to observable
   changes in the FTIR spectrum (the band of Amide I) also induces a
   significant decrease in the protein functional activity. It is also
   found that the influence of similar to 5-nm diamond nanoparticles on
   the protein structure and functions is more significant than that of
   similar to 100-nm nanodiamonds.

AB Formation of the waves of condensation of carbon nanoparticles at
   self-decomposition C3O2 and C2H2, initiated by a shock wave, was
   experimentally observed. It was found that self-sustaining condensation
   wave in C2H2 could be formed at much higher pressures than in C3O2
   despite essential larger heat release of the process C2H2 -> H-2 + soot
   comparably to C3O2 -> 2CO + carbon nanoparticles. The basic kinetic
   characteristics of process of pyrolysis and following growth of
   nanoparticles - induction time and rate constant of particle formation
   are determined for both mixtures. A connection between various stages
   of process and heat release of condensation is analyzed. It is shown
   that induction time in both mixtures is not accompanied by a noticeable
   heat release. For C2H2, duration of this stage is approximately two
   orders of magnitude larger than for C3O2. Against that, the following
   stage of carbon nanoparticle formation, accompanied by an essential
   heat release, proceeds in C3O2 and C2H2 with comparable rates. It is
   demonstrated that distinction in formation of a self-sustained
   condensation wave in C3O2 and C2H2 is caused by the long induction time
   in acetylene reflecting the growth of large polyhydrocarbon molecules.
   The increase in pressure leads to narrowing of this zone and a collapse
   of whole process to a detonation wave of condensation. (C) 2010 The

AB The structure of film composites based on methyl cellulose and fillers,
   such as montmorillonite and silver nanoparticles stabilized by
   poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (Poviargol), is studied by X-ray diffraction. In
   the composite, montmorillonite nanoparticles exist in the exfoliated
   state; when the content of the nanoparticles is below 7 wt %, the
   crystallinity of methyl cellulose increases. Owing to the presence of
   the filler and structural ordering of the matrix, elastic
   characteristics improve and the degradation temperature of the
   composites increases. The X-ray structural data show that the Ag
   particles in the methyl cellulose-Poviargol composite are 30 nm in
   size. The introduction of up to 20 wt % Poviargol assists the
   crystallization of methyl cellulose. The strength and strain
   characteristics of the film composites based on methyl cellulose and

AB The catalytic properties of Co3O4 in NaBH4 and NH3BH3 hydrolysis have
   been studied. Experiments were carried out at 20-40 degrees C using
   0.12 M hydride solution. According to magnetic susceptibility
   measurements, FTIR, XRD, and TEM studies, Co3O4 is reduced to the
   ferromagnetic catalytically active Co2B phase under the action of the
   NaBH4 hydrolysis reaction medium. A correlation was found between the
   content of the cobalt boride phase formed in situ and catalyst
   activity. The reduction of Co3O4 in NH3BH3 proceeds at slower rate than
   in NaBH4. The addition to a solution of NH3BH3 of even a small amount
   of NaBH4 increases considerably the reduction rate of Co3O4. Using a
   Co3O4-based precursor instead of the widely used CoCl2 leads to the
   formation of a stable catalytically active phase of cobalt boride. (C)

AB A magnetic fluid (MF) is a liquid dispersion of magnetic nanoparticles
   coated by surfactants for stabilization. The MF research reviewed in
   this paper is primarily aimed at investigating the atomic and magnetic
   structure of MF particles and the way they interact under various
   conditions by means of small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). The
   presence of a liquid carrier in the structure and the magnetic
   properties of MFs, which are very close to those of an ideal
   superparamagnetic system, allow the effective use of the major neutron
   scattering features: the strong effect of hydrogen deuterium isotopic
   substitution and magnetic scattering. An extension of the contrast
   variation technique to the structure research on polydisperse and
   superparamagnetic systems is proposed. The cases of noninteracting and
   interacting particles, the latter with cluster formation taken into
   account, are considered for non-magnetized and magnetized MFs. The
   polarized neutron scattering analysis of the structure of magnetized
   MFs is illustrated by examples. Topical problems in further developing
   the method to study multiparameter systems are identified.

AB The oblique impacts of nanoclusters are studied theoretically and by
   means of molecular dynamics. In simulations we explore two
   models-Lennard-Jones clusters and particles with covalently bonded
   atoms. In contrast with the case of macroscopic bodies, the standard
   definition of the normal restitution coefficient yields for this
   coefficient negative values for oblique collisions of nanoclusters. We
   explain this effect and propose a proper definition of the restitution
   coefficient which is always positive. We develop a theory of an oblique
   impact based on a continuum model of particles. A surprisingly good
   agreement between the macroscopic theory and simulations leads to the
   conclusion that macroscopic concepts of elasticity, bulk viscosity, and
   surface tension remain valid for nanoparticles of a few hundred atoms.

AB Anumerical method for the calculation of electronic structure of a
   nanosystem composed of a pseudoisocyanine (PIC) molecule assembled on a
   silver nanoparticle is developed. The electronic structure of the
   silver nanoparticle containing 125 atoms is calculated within the local
   density version of the density functional method. A model of an Ag atom
   embedded in the center of a spherical jellium cluster is used. The host
   electron Green's function is calculated by means of the spherically
   symmetric expansion. The principal theoretical tool is the scattering
   theory using the Green's function method. The molecule-silver
   nanosystem interaction is studied using the approach similar to that of
   the Anderson model for transition metal impurities in solids. Localized
   levels are shown to split off from the top of the band of the Ag
   nanoparticle. The electronic structure calculations yield information
   on the character of chemical bonding in the PIC molecule-silver
   particle nanosystem.

ID ORIGIN; LIFE
AB The Earth's biosphere appeared in a self-organization process along
   with the appearance of the Solar System. It is shown, based on the
   methods of self-organization examination and existing knowledge, that
   major stages of the chemical evolution in the early development of the
   biosphere include the "cold pre-history of life" in dense molecular
   nebulae, "pre-planetary chemocoenosis," "RNA-world" in a circumsolar
   nebula, and primary biocoenoses of protocells (life) on the planetary
   bodies. Estimates for carbon in the pri-mordial biosphere on the young
   Earth's surface give 2.4 x 10(19) kg. The decay of the primordial
   Earth's biomass and biogeochemical cycles in 2.5 Myr led to the "planet
   of bacteria" with 2.0 x 10(15) kg of biota in the Proterozoic (at the
   time of an oxygenated atmosphere). The main parameters (pressure,
   temperature, and state of catalytic solid phase) are estimated for
   these stages of the early evolution of life. It is shown that the
   abiogenic synthesis of the primordial matter was preformed in the Solar
   System on a grand scale with practically every atom in
   nanoparticles-catalysts participating. Selection among catalytically
   active nanoparticles worked towards the ability to synthesize high
   molecular compounds in a protoplanetary disk. Autocatalysts
   participated in the preplanetary chemical evolution, beginning from
   such simple substances as ethylene or glycolaldehyde. Primary synthesis
   of autocatalysts depended on external sources of energy, e.g., on
   ultraviolet radiation.

AB In this paper, we report a facile, an environmental friendly
   ultrasonic-assisted hydrothermal route for preparation of goethite
   flower structures using Fe nanopowders at low temperature (85A degrees
   C). The flower structure consisted of tens of hundreds of nanowires and
   such structures can further self-assemble with the flake with micro
   size area. Structural, morphological, and elemental analysis revealed
   that the products consisted of flower-like structures with high
   structural uniformity, good crystal quality, and high yields.
   Influencing factors such as the reaction temperature, pH value, and the
   deposition time were systematically investigated. A possible formation
   mechanism was proposed on the basis of the experimental results.
   Magnetic measurements showed that the as-obtained goethite flowers
   exhibited weakly ferromagnetic characteristics at room temperature,
   which were quite different from those of the corresponding bulk
   materials.

AB This article reports the chemical deposition of silver shells on the
   surface of hollow glass microspheres. This was accomplished by using
   titanium dioxide, derived from titanium (IV) tetra-n-butoxide, as the
   surface modifier. Two routes of formation of thin titanium dioxide
   layers on the substrate were compared in terms of composition and
   properties: photochemical approach and atmospheric hydrolysis. The
   structure and composition of the samples were characterized by atomic
   force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, IR spectroscopy,
   electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The resulting thickness of uniform
   silver shells on the surface of microspheres averaged out at 1.0-1.25
   mu m.

AB It was established that partial combustion of carbon constituting the
   walls of multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) catalyzed by previously
   deposited CaCO3 nanoparticles converts parallel graphene layers in a
   multiwall structure to aggregates formed by nano-onions with a diameter
   of 5-12 nm. The areas with positive curvature of graphene layers on the
   external surface of air-etched MWCNTs played the role of docking
   stations for nickel nanoparticles inserted by sonochemical deposition
   after removal of the CaCO3. The nickel nanoparticles were located
   exclusively at the tops of the onions. Formation of nanoscale curvature
   at the MWCNT support surfaces decreased the average size of Ni
   nanocrystals at similar loading of 50-60 wt% from 8 to 2 nm. Partial
   catalytic combustion did not change the concentration of surface
   carbonyl groups measured by titration, which attributes the observed
   phenomena directly to the corrugation of the MWCNT surfaces. The
   catalytic tests revealed a significant increase of catalytic activity
   of supported Ni catalyst due to corrugating of the external surface of
   the MWCNT support. After oxidative etching of the MWCNTs, the rate of
   chloroacetophenone hydrogenation measured with a Ni-MWCNT catalyst
   increased by a factor of 2 without change in selectivity yielding
   chlorophenylethanol as the main product.

AB Spherical nanoparticles (SNPs) were generated by two-step thermal
   remodelling of native tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) at 94 degrees C.
   Particles of irregular shape and varying size were generated by TMV at
   90 degrees C. They could be converted into SNPs by heating at 94
   degrees C and were considered to be intermediate precursors of SNPs. In
   addition to SNP monomers (53 nm diameter), generated by individual TMV
   virions, large SNPs (100-800 nm diameter) were assembled. The size of
   the SNPs depended on the TMV concentration. The SNPs could be generated
   by distinct forms of RNA-free TMV coat protein (CP) aggregates and
   individual CP subunits. A one-step SNP assembly appeared to occur in
   these cases. These results show that SNPs represent a new type of
   particle nanoplatform for producing compositions of SNPs with foreign
   protein molecules bound to their surface.

AB Heat generation by viscous dissipation in a dilute suspension of
   single-domain ferromagnetic particles in a rotating magnetic field is
   analyzed by assuming that the suspended particles have a high magnetic
   rigidity. The problem is solved by using a kinetic approach based on a
   rotational diffusion equation. Behavior of specific loss power (SLP) as
   a function of field strength H and frequency omega is examined at
   constant temperature. SLP increases as either of these parameters
   squared when the other is constant, eventually approaching a saturation
   value. The function SLP(H, omega) can be used to determine optimal and

ID MAGNETIC-PROPERTIES; PHASE; NANOPARTICLES; OXIDATION; CATALYSTS;

AB Classical Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner theory is generalized for Ostwald
   ripening of particles composed of random binary alloy. We show that the
   steady state ripening process is characterized by self-similar particle
   size and composition distributions. The shape of particle size
   distribution depends on whether the process is diffusion controlled
   (Lifshitz-Slyozov) or reaction controlled (Wagner) and is consistent
   with the predictions of classical theory for one-component materials.
   The steady state composition distribution, in contrast, has the same
   functional form in both extreme cases featuring a universal dependence
   of the composition upon particle size. We also found that transients in
   particle's composition can be very quick resulting in a steady state
   distribution well before it is reached by particles sizes. These
   transients involve significant changes in particle sizes and open an
   opportunity for producing metastable particle size distributions of
   required shape. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics. [doi:

   GLASSES; ION DEPLETION; DYNAMICS; SODIUM
AB By examining the electric field induced processes in glasses and
   glass-metal nanocomposites (GMN) we propose mechanism of the electric
   field assisted dissolution (EFAD) of metal nanoparticles in glass. We
   show that in both glass poling and EFAD processes, the strong (up to 1
   V/nm) local electric field in the subanodic region is due to the
   presence of "slow" hydrogen ions bonded to nonbridging oxygen atoms in
   glass matrix. However, the origin of these hydrogen ions in glass and
   GMN is different. Specifically, when we apply the electric field to a
   virgin glass, the enrichment of the glass with hydrogen species takes
   place in the course of the poling. In GMN, the hydrogen ions have been
   incorporated into the glass matrix during metal nanoparticles formation
   via reduction in a metal by hydrogen, i.e., before the electric field
   was applied. The EFAD of metal nanoparticles resembles the electric
   field stimulated diffusion of metal film in glass (the important
   difference however is that in GMN, there is no direct contact of
   dissolving metal entity with anodic electrode). This similarity makes
   it possible to estimate the energy of thermal activated transition of
   silver atoms from a nanoparticle to glass matrix as similar to 1.3 eV.
   Electroneutrality of the GMN requires emission of electrons from
   nanoparticles. Photoconductivity spectra of soda-lime glasses and the
   results of numerical calculations of band structure of fused silica,
   sodium disilicate and sodium-calcium-silicate glass enable us to
   evaluate the bandgap and the position of electron mobility edge in
   soda-lime glass. The evaluated values are similar to 6 eV and similar
   to 1.2 eV below vacuum level, respectively. The bent of the glass band
   structure in strong electric field permits a direct tunneling of Fermi
   electrons from silver nanoparticle (4.6 eV below the vacuum level) to
   the glass conductivity band. Evaluated in accordance with the
   Fowler-Nordheim equation the magnitude of electric field necessary to
   establish comparable electron emission and ion ejection rates is
   similar to 0.27 V/nm, although other phenomena including polarization
   of the nanoparticles and tunneling of electrons thermally distributed
   above Fermi level, decreases this magnitude. We believe that the
   different mechanisms of ejection for electrons and ions should result
   in charging nanoparticles in EFAD process. The electron tunneling to
   localized OH- states and glass matrix relaxation process are also
   discussed. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

AB The results of the numerical simulation of field-cooled and zero
   field-cooled (ZFC) experiments in a dilute assembly of
   superparamagnetic nanoparticles with uniaxial anisotropy are presented.
   The numerical simulation uses a solution of the kinetic rate equations
   for population numbers of the potential wells. The particle relaxation
   times are rigorously obtained from the corresponding Fokker-Planck
   equation. For an assembly of particles with a single diameter a
   monotonic decrease in a blocking temperature as a function of the
   applied magnetic field is found, the blocking temperatures of aligned
   and randomly oriented assemblies being close. For an assembly with
   lognormal volume distribution the location of the maximum at the ZFC
   assembly magnetization differs considerably from the blocking
   temperature of particles with the average diameter. Equating of both
   quantities may lead to a considerable overestimation of the particle
   effective anisotropy constant. The effective blocking temperature of
   the assembly with lognormal volume distribution may experience
   nonmonotonic magnetic field dependence, as the particles of large
   diameters begin to contribute to the assembly magnetization with the
   increase in the applied field. A prominent dependence of the ZFC
   assembly magnetization maximum on the width of the lognormal
   distribution is also revealed. (c) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

AB The effect of noise on the process of high-speed remagnetization of

   nanoparticles is studied by means of computer simulation of
   Landau-Lifshits model. The mean switching time (MST) and its standard

   clockwise vorticities have been computed. It has been demonstrated that
   with the reversal by the pulse with sinusoidal shape, the optimal pulse
   duration exists, which minimizes both the MST and the SD. Besides, both
   MST and SD significantly depend on the angle between the reversal
   magnetic field and pentagon edge, and the optimal angle roughly equals
   10 degrees. Also, it is demonstrated that the optimization of the
   angle, duration and the amplitude of the driving field leads to
   significant decrease in both MST and SD. In particular, for the
   considered parameters, the MST can be decreased from 60 ns to 2-3 ns.
   Such a chain of magnetic nanoparticles can effectively be used as an
   element of magnetoresistive memory, and at the temperature 300 K the
   stable operation of the element is observed up to rather small size of
   nanoparticles with the radius of 20 nm. (C) 2011 American Institute of

AB Nanodiamond has recently attracted great attention for its intrinsic
   luminescence in the visible range which can be used as a tracking
   marker in many biological applications. In this work, photoluminescence
   (PL) of nanodiamonds interacting with biological macromolecules, such
   as proteins lysozyme and albumin, is studied. Proteins were physically
   adsorbed on carboxylated nanodiamonds surfaces. The PL spectra of the
   protein-nanodiamond complex were measured. It is shown that the surface
   passivation can modify the nanodiamond luminescence properties. Changes
   in shape and spectral positions of the nanodiamond PL band were
   observed and found to depend on excitation wavelength. We attribute the
   effects to the surface energy traps and transfer between protein and
   surface nanostructures, particular the graphitelike nanoclusters. This
   study is important for the bio and medical applications of nanodiamonds
   used as a biocompatible label. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

AB The propagation of electromagnetic waves at microwave frequencies was
   investigated numerically in SiO2 opal based magnetic nanostructures,
   using rigorous mathematical models solving Maxwell's equations with
   electrodynamic boundary conditions, complemented by the Landau-Lifshitz
   equation. The numerical approach is based on the Galerkin's projection
   method using the decomposition algorithm on autonomous blocks with
   Floquet channels. The opal structure consists of 250 nm SiO2
   nanospheres, with inter-sphere voids infiltrated with octagonal
   nanoparticles of either Ni0.7Zn0.3Fe2O4 with 4 pi M-s = 5 kG, or
   NiFe2O4 with 4 pi M-s = 3.12 kG. Both the opal matrix and the ferrite
   are assumed to be lossy through complex dielectric constants. The field
   dependence of the complex wave number of the fundamental extraordinary
   mode of the propagating EMWs in the 3-D opal-based magnetophotonic
   crystals was determined for transverse orientation of the bias magnetic
   field at a frequency of 9.375 GHz. The numerical technique shows an
   excellent agreement when applied to model recent experimental data of
   waveguide measurements on similar ferrite opals.

TI Hydrothermal noble opal: Structure and genesis
SO GEOLOGY OF ORE DEPOSITS

DT Article
AB The results of the study of hydrothermal noble opal are discussed. it
   has been established that hydrothermal opal differs in its
   nanostructure and formation conditions from exogenic noble opal. The
   former is composed of smaller globules without any structuring of
   closely packed nanoparticles characteristic of exogenic opal. In the
   course of formation, hydrothermal opal is affected by pneumatolytic
   annealing related to the effect of high-temperature vapors under an
   elevated pressure. At the same time, the thermal effect results in the
   formation of two-dimensional photon zones in the chaotic opal matrix.
   These photon zones are produced by grids, the cells of which arose from
   a thermal effect similar to what related to Benard cells. Precisely,
   these structured blocks and thin films lead to spectral dispersion of
   light and appearance of iridescence.

AB Recent advances in wet chemical synthesis and biomolecular
   functionalization of gold nanoparticles have led to a dramatic
   expansion of their potential biomedical applications, including
   biosensorics, bioimaging, photothermal therapy, and targeted drug
   delivery. As the range of gold nanoparticle types and their
   applications continues to increase, human safety concerns are gaining
   attention, which makes it necessary to better understand the potential
   toxicity hazards of these novel materials. Whereas about 80 reports on
   the in vivo biodistribution and in vitro cell toxicity of gold
   nanoparticles are available in the literature, there is lack of
   correlation between both fields and there is no clear understanding of
   intrinsic nanoparticle effects. At present, the major obstacle is the
   significant discrepancy in experimental conditions under which
   biodistribution and toxicity effects have been evaluated. This critical
   review presents a detailed analysis of data on the in vitro and in vivo
   biodistribution and toxicity of most popular gold nanoparticles,
   including atomic clusters and colloidal particles of diameters from 1
   to 200 nm, gold nanoshells, nanorods, and nanowires. Emphasis is placed
   on the systematization of data over particle types and parameters,
   particle surface functionalization, animal and cell models, organs
   examined, doses applied, the type of particle administration and the
   time of examination, assays for evaluating gold particle toxicity, and
   methods for determining the gold concentration in organs and
   distribution of particles over cells. On the basis of a critical
   analysis of data, we arrive at some general conclusions on key
   nanoparticle parameters, methods of particle surface modification, and
   doses administered that determine the type and kinetics of
   biodistribution and toxicity at cellular and organismal levels (197
   references).

AB Physicochemical properties important in exposure characterisation of
   four different welding aerosols were investigated. Particle number size
   distributions were determined by scanning mobility particle sizer
   (SMPS), mass size distributions by separation and weighing the
   individual size fractions of an 11-stage cascade impactor. The size
   distribution of the primary particles of agglomerates, chemical
   composition and morphology of the particles were examined by TEM. There
   were significant differences in the particle number size distributions
   of the different welding aerosols according to the SMPS determinations.
   The particle mass size distributions determined gravimetrically were,
   however, not really different. The dominant range with respect to mass
   was between 0.1 and 1 mu m, regardless of the welding technique. Most
   of the primary particles in all different welding aerosols had
   diameters between 5 and 40 nm. All types of primary particles had a
   tendency to form chainlike agglomerates. A clear size dependence of the
   particle chemical composition was encountered in the case of manual
   metal arc welding aerosol. Small particles with diameters below 50 nm
   were mostly metal oxides in contrast to larger particles which also
   contained more volatile elements (e.g. potassium, fluorine, sodium,
   sulphur).

AB A new method based on the use of quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) as

   system to measure the rupture force and deduce size distribution of
   nanoparticles. As suggested by model predictions, the QCM is shaped as

   investigated theoretically. Recommendations concerning the use of the
   method for measuring the nanoparticle size distribution are presented.
   It is shown experimentally for an ensemble of test particles with a
   characteristic size within 20-30 nm that the proposed method allows one
   to determine particle size distribution. On the basis of the position
   and value of the measured rupture signal, a histogram of particle size
   distribution and percentage of each size fraction were determined. The
   main merits of the bond-rupture method are its rapid response,
   simplicity and the ability to discriminate between specific and
   non-specific interactions. The method is highly sensitive with respect
   to mass (the sensitivity is generally dependent on the chemical nature
   of receptor and analyte and may reach 8 x 10(-14) g mm(-2)) and
   applicable to measuring rupture forces either for weak bonds, for
   example hydrogen bonds, or for strong covalent bonds (10(-11)-10(-9)
   N). This procedure may become a good alternative for the existing
   methods, such as AFM or optical methods of determining biological
   objects, and win a broad range of applications both in laboratory
   research and in biosensing for various purposes. Possible applications
   include medicine, diagnostics, environmental or agricultural
   monitoring. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A new macrocyclic, bolaamphiphile with thiocytosine fragments in the
   molecule. (B1) has been synthesized and advanced as perspective
   platform for the design of soft supramolecular systems. Strong
   concentration-dependent structural behavior: is observed in the
   water-DMF (20% vol) solution of B1 as revealed by methods of
   tensiometry, conductometry, dynamic light scattering, and atomic force
   microscopy. Two breakpoints are observed in the surface tension
   isotherms. The first one, around 0.002 M, is identified as a critical
   micelle concentration (cmc), whereas the second critical concentration
   of 0.01 M is a turning point between the two models of the association
   involved. Large aggregates of ca. 200 nm are mostly formed beyond the
   cmc, whereas small micelle-like aggregates exist above 0.01 M. The
   growth of aggregates between these critical points occurs, resulting in
   a gel-like behavior. An unusual decrease in the solution pH with
   concentration takes place, which is assumed to originate from the
   steric hindrance around the B1 head groups. Because Of controllable
   structural behavior, B1 is assumed to be a candidate for the
   development of biomimetic catalysts, nanocontainers, drug and gene
   carriers, etc.

AB Controlling cavitation at the solid surface is of increasing interest,
   as it plays a major role in many physical and chemical processes
   related to the modification of solid surfaces and formation of
   multicomponent nanoparticles. Here, we show a selective control of
   ultrasonic cavitation on metal surfaces with different hydrophobicity.
   By applying a microcontact printing technique we successfully formed
   hydrophobic/hydrophilic alternating well-defined microstructures on
   aluminium surfaces. Fabrication of patterned surfaces provides the
   unique opportunity to verify a model of heterogeneous nucleation of
   cavitation bubbles near the solid/water interface by varying the
   wettability of the surface, temperature and ultrasonic power. At the
   initial stage of sonication (up to 30 min), microjets and shock waves
   resulting from the collapsing bubbles preferably impact the hydrophobic
   surface, whereas the hydrophilic areas of the patterned Al remain
   unchanged. Longer sonication periods affect both surfaces. These
   findings confirm the expectation that higher contact angle causes a
   lower energy barrier, thus cavitation dominates at the hydrophobic
   surfaces. Experimental results are in good agreement with expectations
   from nucleation theory. This paper illustrates a new approach to
   ultrasound induced modification of solid surfaces resulting in the
   formation of foam-structured metal surfaces.

AB A computer-aided method of analysis of nanocomposite textures on the
   basis of calculation of the fractal dimensions of nanostructures using
   microphotographs of the nanocomposites is proposed. The computer-aided
   method of assessment of the fractal dimensions is notable for the use
   of an algorithm of calculation of the self-similarity indices of the
   power spectra of two-dimensional luminance fields of the nanostructure
   imaging on microphotographs and the use of the box-counting algorithm
   for measurement of the fractal dimensions. This method makes it
   possible to assess the rates and directions of cluster growth in the
   nanocomposite texture. On the basis of numerous computer experiments
   using the method proposed, we have ascertained that dark zones of two
   types are present on microphotographs of the texture of the
   nanocomposites obtained by sedimentation of tin oxides and formation of
   fine-particle silicon carbide: homogeneous zones, where there is no
   manifestation of the fine structure of the nanocomposites, and
   indistinctly contoured structured zones that hypothetically can
   correspond to the formation of new clusters or ensembles of
   nanoparticles.

AB The reaction of the hydrogenation of a mixture of carbon oxides on

   and their bimetallic mechanical mixtures was investigated. It was
   established that the main reaction product on UDP Ni is methane, while
   the main products on the bimetallic systems are methane and ethylene. A
   synergetic effect was observed on the bimetallic catalyst under
   investigation. It was revealed that the hydrogenation of a mixture of
   carbon oxides proceeds through the stage of dissociative adsorption of
   both components, CO and CO2. The olefin selectivity of the process was
   explained by the participation of different forms of adsorbed hydrogen
   (H-I : H-II) at the catalyst surface. It is assumed that the
   hydrogenation of carbon oxides on iron-nickel catalysts proceeds either
   through the jum-pover effect or via hydrogen spillover.

   considered. The problem is treated in the framework of kinetic
   approach. The behavior of specific loss power (SLP) as a function of
   the field amplitude and frequency is studied. It is shown that for
   either of these parameters (while the other is kept constant) SLP first
   grows quadratically and then saturates. The cases of a rotating field
   and oscillating fields are compared, and the essential differences are
   revealed. The results obtained enable one to assess the allowable or

ID FILMS
AB We report on the large nonsaturated transverse magnetoresistance (TMR)
   effect in InN films grown by plasma-assisted molecular-beam epitaxy. It
   is proved that the origin of the TMR effect in InN epilayers is the
   presence of spontaneously formed In nanoparticles. The effect of the In
   nanoparticles on the transport properties of the InN films is discussed
   in detail, accompanied by supporting theoretical calculations. The role
   of electronic parameters of the InN semiconductor matrix as well as the
   size and amount of In nanoparticles, which govern the magnitude of the
   TMR effect, has been determined. The negative TMR effect observed in
   Mg-doped InN films is also considered within the same
   metal-semiconductor composite model. It is proposed that high Mg
   concentration leads to the formation of specific modification of size
   and arrangement of the In inclusions.

TI Nanometer-scale mapping of the strain and Ge content of Ge/Si quantum
   dots using enhanced Raman scattering by the tip of an atomic force
   microscope
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
LA English

ID ALLOY COMPOSITION; ISLANDS; SI(001); SIGE
AB Tip-enhanced Raman spectra of as-grown self-assembled Ge/Si quantum
   dots have been obtained with nanoscale spatial resolution. It is found
   that Ge-Ge and Si-Ge modes in the Raman spectra are significantly
   enhanced only when the atomic force microscope tip with a gold
   nanoparticle is positioned on the dots. It is also found that the Si
   substrate peak at 520 cm(-1) is shifted considerably in the
   neighborhood of the dots. This implies that a large stress acts on the
   Si substrate around the dots. The Ge content reduces at the center of
   the dots. This result suggests that the dots consist of a Si-rich core
   and a Ge-rich shell. The Ge content decreases and the strain in the Si
   substrate increases with an increase in the dot height.

AB Measurements of proton nuclear spin-spin and spin-lattice relaxation
   times are applied for determining the concentration of solid-phase
   nanoparticles in nanofluids. This approach is tested for metal oxides
   SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3 and metal-carbon nanoparticles of 3d-metals Fe and
   Cu. It is shown that the sensitivity of the method for determining
   concentrations of 3d-metals is much higher than for oxides (by 2-4
   orders of magnitude). It is revealed that measurement of the proton
   spin-spin relaxation time allows one to determine the concentration of
   Cu nanoparticles to 0.0001 mg/ml and that of Fe nanoparticles to
   0.00001 mg/ml.

   zinc oxide (ZnO) and titanium dioxide (TiO2), for sunscreen
   applications considering their intrinsic physical properties and the
   Mie theory. These properties cause, from one side, attenuation of the
   ultraviolet light by absorption and scattering (dependent on a particle
   size), which is the purpose sunscreens are designed for, and formation
   of free radicals (i.e., phototoxicity) during this process-from the
   other. Particle penetration into skin is also an important issue
   addressed in this review due to possible adverse effects associated
   with interaction between nanoparticles and skin living cells.

   on the Pt nanoparticle size (in the range from 1 to 4 nm) was studied.
   The specific catalytic activity increases with an increase in the
   platinum nanoparticle size, indicating that the total oxidation is a
   structure-sensitive reaction. The structure sensitivity depends on the
   size of an oxidized molecule: it increases sharply on going from CH4 to
   n-C4H10. The support also exerts a considerable effect on the A (sp)
   value: in the oxidation of both CH4 and C4H10 the specific catalytic

DE gold-sulfide deposits; gold-bearing arsenopyrite; eastern Kazakhstan
ID INVISIBLE GOLD; ARSENIAN PYRITE; NANOPARTICLES
AB We have revealed early productive disseminated pyrite-arsenopyrite
   mineralization with invisible gold in tectonic zones and late
   nest-veinlet gold-polysulfide mineralization with free gold in zones of
   silicified rocks at the Suzdal' (Suzdal'skoe), Zherek, and Bol'shevik
   deposits in eastern Kazakhstan, localized within black shales. Two
   varieties of arsenopyrite differing in morphology, chemical
   composition, and gold contents have been established in them:
   acicular-prismatic and tabular. Gold was determined by a specially
   elaborated technique ensuring a detection limit of 30 ppm Au.
   Acicular-prismatic arsenopyrite is the main ore mineral of the early
   productive stage of mineralization; it has high gold contents
   (1400-5360 ppm) and a nonstoichiometric composition (S/As = 1.2) and is
   slightly depleted in Fe. The absence of correlation between the
   contents of the main arsenopyrite components and gold, and the strongly
   uneven distribution of gold among the mineral grains, and within a
   grain point to the presence of invisible gold, as elemental particles
   deposited together with arsenopyrite. Tabular arsenopyrite is abundant
   at the Suzdal' deposit, where gold-polysulfide mineralization and
   argillization are widespread. It has low gold and high antimony
   contents and a stoichiometric composition. Visible gold usually grows
   over tabular arsenopyrite. The isotopic composition of sulfur of
   acicular-prismatic arsenopyrite and globular-crystalline pyrite, formed
   at the early mineralization stages, is characterized by delta S-34 =
   0.0 to -3.3% and evidences a mantle source of sulfur with a partial
   borrowing of crustal sulfur. The tabular arsenopyrite and other
   sulfides of the second productive mineralization show a lighter
   isotopic composition of sulfur (delta S-34 = -7.7 to -10.2%), which is
   due to sulfur fractionation under high oxygen fugacity at the late ore
   deposition stage. The coexistence of two sets of arsenopyrite of
   different morphologic varieties and compositions at the deposit points
   to a long ore deposition, the coexistence of mineralization formed at
   different stages, and the evolution of physicochemical parameters. (C)

AB This paper considers nanostructuring of solid surfaces by nano-optical
   techniques, primarily by laser particle nanolithography. Threshold
   processes are examined that can be used for laser structuring of solid
   surfaces, with particular attention to laser swelling of materials.
   Fundamental spatial resolution issues in three-dimensional (3D) laser
   nanostructuring are analysed with application to laser
   nanopolymerisation and 3D optical information recording. The formation
   of nanostructures in the bulk of solids due to their structural
   instability under irradiation is exemplified by photo-induced formation
   of nanocomposites.

AB The boundary problem of light reflection and transmission by a film
   with chaotically distributed nanoinclusions is considered. Based on the
   proposed microscopic approach, analytic expressions are derived for
   distributions inside and outside the nanocomposite medium. Good
   agreement of the results with exact calculations and (at low
   concentrations of nanoparticles) with the integral Maxwell-Garnett
   effective-medium theory is demonstrated. It is shown that at high
   nanoparticle concentrations, averaging the dielectric constant in
   volume as is done within the framework of the effective-medium theory
   yields overestimated values of the optical film density compared to the
   values yielded by the proposed microscopic approach. We also studied
   the dependence of the reflectivity of a system of gold nanoparticles on
   their size, the size dependence of the plasmon resonance position along
   the wavelength scale, and demonstrated a good agreement with
   experimental data.

AB Understanding the nature of interactions between engineered
   nanomaterials and plants is crucial in comprehending the impact of
   nanotechnology on the environment and agriculture with a focus on
   toxicity concerns, plant disease treatment, and genetic engineering. To
   date, little progress has been made in studying nanoparticle-plant
   interactions at single nanoparticle and genetic levels. Here, we
   introduce an advanced platform integrating genetic, Raman,
   photothermal, and photoacoustic methods. Using this approach, we
   discovered that multiwall carbon nanotubes induce previously unknown
   changes in gene expression in tomato leaves and roots, particularly,
   up-regulation of the stress-related genes, including those induced by
   pathogens and the water-channel LeAqp2 gene. A nano-bubble amplified
   photothermal/photoacoustic imaging, spectroscopy, and burning technique
   demonstrated the detection of multiwall carbon nanotubes in roots,
   leaves, and fruits down to the single nanoparticle and cell level.
   Thus, our integrated platform allows the study of nanoparticles' impact
   on plants with higher sensitivity and specificity, compared to existing
   assays.

AB Organic-inorganic hybrid films are prepared via the hydrolysis and
   polycondensation of tetraethoxysilane in chitosan solutions. It is
   shown that the composition of reagents, the time of synthesis, the
   crosslinking of chitosan macromolecules via amino groups by glutaric
   aldehyde, and the conditions of drying affect structurization of the
   resulting films. With the use of optical polarization microscopy and
   atomic force microscopy, it is found that the films contain silica
   particles with a wide size distribution. The crosslinking of the
   chitosan matrix by glutaric aldehyde results in the predominant
   formation of inorganic nanoparticles in the films. A good sorption
   capacity of the films for copper ions in solutions is found. It
   increases by a factor of 1.7 as the content of the silica in the films
   increases to 30 wt %.

AB In the reaction system of

   concentrations and ratios between compounds on the structure and
   characteristics of the formed organic-inorganic hybrid hydrogels based
   on poly(N-vinylcaprolactam) and silica particles is studied. When the
   over-all concentration of precursors is increased, the number of bonds
   between hydrogel components increases, and an increase in the number of
   network crosslinks is provided by an increased fraction of
   tetramethoxysilane. The method of small-angle X-ray analysis is used to
   estimate quantitative structural characteristics of silica particles in
   hydrogels. Silica particles are found to form a fractal
   three-dimensional structure, which is composed of individual compact
   clusters with lateral dimensions of 40-60 angstrom. The average linear
   dimensions of scattering anisometric particles are 100 x 120 x 360
   angstrom. A model for the three-dimensional structure is proposed for
   hydrogel formed via the interaction of poly(N-vinylcaprolactam)
   macromolecules and silica nanoparticles. The average distance between
   silica particles is estimated.

   the surface of amorphous silica particles is studied using electronic
   structure calculations at the DFT-D level of theory taking into account

   different types are used; two of them have been constructed using
   classical MD methods. The effect of particle size, local environment,
   and the choice of the exchange-correlation functional and basis set on
   the adsorption energies is studied, and adsorption energies are
   extrapolated to nanosized clusters. It is shown that the dye is more
   strongly bound to amorphous silica particles than the studied analyte
   molecules and that the energy of DPAA adsorption increases with the
   particle size, being at least twice as high as the energy of analyte
   adsorption for nanosized clusters. Electrostatic interactions play an
   important role in the adsorption of acridine dyes on the surface of
   silica nanoparticles.

AB Aligned multiwall carbon nanotube (NT) arrays were used for deposition
   of cadmium sulfide (CdS), nanoparticles from an aqueous solution
   containing thiourea, CdCl2, and ammonia. Scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM) showed that used deposition technique does not destroy vertical
   orientation of CNTs to silicon substrate. The size of CdS nanoparticles
   formed on the side surface and ends of CNTs was estimated by
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to be about 30 nm. It was found
   that CdS nanoparticles became luminescent during field electron
   emission from CNTs. Different color of the luminescence image was
   related to different size of the nanoparticles.

AB Recently, nanodiamond particles have attracted increasing attention as
   a promising nanomaterial for its biocompatibility, easy
   functionalization and conjugation with biomolecules, and its superb
   physical/chemical properties. Nanodiamonds are mainly used as markers
   for cell imaging, using its fluorescence or Raman signals for
   detection, and as carriers for drug delivery. For the success of these
   applications, the biomolecule associated with the nanodiamond has to
   retain its functionality. In this work, the protein activities of egg
   white lysozyme adsorbed on nanodiamond particles of different sizes is
   investigated. The lysozyme nanodiamond complex is used here as a
   protein model for analyzing its structural conformation changes and,
   correspondingly, its enzymatic activity after the adsorption.
   Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is used for the analysis
   of the sensitive protein secondary structure. To access the activities
   of the adsorbed lysozyme, a fluorescence-based assay is used. The
   process of adsorption is also analyzed using UV-visible spectroscopic
   measurements in combination with analysis of nanodiamond properties
   with FTIR, Raman spectroscopy, and zeta-potential measurements. It is
   found that the activity of lysozyme upon adsorption depends on the
   nanodiamond's size and surface properties, and that the nanodiamond
   particles can be selected and treated, which do not alter the lysozyme
   functional properties. Such nanodiamonds can be considered convenient
   nanoparticles for various bioapplications.

   nanoparticles has been studied in Triton X-100 (TX-100) solutions at
   various concentration conditions by fluorimetry, dynamic light
   scattering, electrophoresis and transmission electron microscopy
   methods. The temperature responsive behavior of nanoparticles is
   observed at definite concentration of TX-100, where the aggregation of
   TX-100 at the silica/water interface is evident from the increased size
   of the silica nanoparticles. The reversible dehydration of TX-100
   aggregates at the silica/water interface should be assumed as the main
   reason of the temperature induced phase separation of silica
   nanoparticles. The distribution of nanoparticles between aqueous and
   surfactant rich phases at the phase separation conditions can be
   modified by the effect of additives. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB The demand to quantify the elemental composition of very small sample
   amounts and/or of samples which form artefacts during conventional
   sample preparations is increasing. Example applications are the
   quantification of engineered metal(loid) based nanomaterials in
   environmental samples, e. g. (i) the direct analyses of engineered
   nanoparticle (ENP) suspensions showing broad particle size
   distributions which are not suitable to be applied via the spray
   chamber in ICP-MS analyses, (ii) measurements of single invertebrates
   and tissue of selected organs which were exposed to ENPs, and (iii)
   whole plants or plant parts e. g. from Lemna sp. The use of imaging
   based high resolution methods like atomic force microscopy or
   environmental scanning electron microscopy creates the need to quantify
   the elemental composition of the visualised objects as directly and
   exactly as possible, at very low limits of detection. With this study
   the authors present a method/concept for the multi-element
   quantification of analytes from ENPs in complex matrices with different
   degrees of complexity by graphite furnace electrothermal vaporisation
   coupled to inductively coupled plasma quadrupole mass spectrometry
   equipped with collision/reaction cell (GF-ETV-ICP-QMS).

AB A systematic analysis of the impact of laser radiation on disordered
   metal nanoparticle aggregates has been carried out using the simplest
   model of a resonance domain in the form of a bisphere. Such aggregates
   can be considered as a set of elementary domains with different
   eigen-resonant frequencies. The model is basically a pair of bound
   spherical nanoparticles having equal radii and covered with a polymer
   adsorption layer. A significant change in the resonance properties of
   the domain occurs due to the change of interparticle gaps under applied
   radiation. We investigated the temporal variation of parameters and
   hence optical characteristics of coupled Ag nanoparticles under pulsed
   laser radiation for different wavelengths, intensities and pulse
   durations and for different initial values of the interparticle gap.

AB The possibility of generation of a surface plasmon resonance by gold
   nanoparticles in a 3D network polymer matrix upon irradiation of a
   liquid acrylic composition containing a dissolved Au3+ salt is
   demonstrated for the first time. UV-irradiation of the solution
   simultaneously causes gold photoreduction to Au-0 and acrylate
   photopolymerization. The possibility of preparing transparent colorless
   films that, when heated or exposed to light, give rise to a
   visible-spectrum absorption band belonging to a plasmon resonance of
   metal nanoparticles is demonstrated. The intensity and position of the
   plasmon resonance band depend on the parameters of the 3D polymer
   network, chemical structure of the oligomer, type of the support, and
   conditions of formation of Au-0 particles. The formation of reduced
   gold nanoparticles responsible for the plasmon resonance band occurs
   more effectively in low-density networks with a large interchain length
   and containing oligomer block capable of complexation with the metal.
   The formation of nanoparticles is affected by the chlorine-containing
   products of the reduction of the gold salt.

AB The physicochemical characteristics of nanosized energetic materials
   (aluminum, ammonium nitrate, RDX) are studied and the burning rate of
   energetic condensed systems containing nanosized components is
   determined. The morphology, chemical purity, and thermal properties of
   nanosized powders produced by vacuum and plasma recondensation were
   examined. The materials obtained are identical to the precursors and
   are characterized by an increased reactivity compared to their
   microsized counterparts. At a pressure of 100 atm, a monopropellant
   prepared from nanosized RDX particles is found to have twice as high
   the burning velocity as a microsized RDX propellant. For
   nanoaluminum-ammonium perchlorate compositions, the burning velocity is
   demonstrated to be an order of magnitude higher than that for similar
   compositions with microsized aluminum. An important feature of
   nanoaluminum-based formulations is a decrease in the degree of
   agglomeration of metal fuel products and, hence, in two-phase losses in
   solid-propellant rocket engines.

DE nanoheterogeneous films; titanium oxide doped with molybdenum oxide
AB Thin films of titanium oxide nanoparticles doped with molybdenum oxide
   were synthesized by vacuum cocondensation of titanium atom and
   molybdenum oxide molecule flows onto a substrate cooled with liquid
   nitrogen. Atomic-force, scanning tunnel, and scanning electron
   microscopy were used to study the structure and composition of the
   films. It was shown that doping caused the formation of a large number
   of point defects in the titanium oxide lattice and an increase in its
   specific conductivity. Point defects were three-dimensional F centers
   and surface hydrate complexes. Tests of films as photoanodes in a
   photoelectrochemical cell showed that doping of titanium oxide with
   molybdenum oxide offered promise for increasing the effectiveness of
   sources for the decentralized production of hydrogen by electrochemical
   methods.

AB Colloidal silver has gained wide acceptance as an antimicrobial agent,
   and various substrates coated with nanosilver such as fabrics,
   plastics, and metal have been shown to develop antimicrobial
   properties. Here, a simple method to develop coating of colloidal
   silver on paper using ultrasonic radiation is presented, and the
   coatings are characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), high
   resolution scanning electron microscope (HRSEM), and thermogravimetry
   (TGA) measurements. Depending on the variables such as precursor
   concentrations and ultrasonication time, uniform coatings ranging from
   90 to 150 nm in thickness have been achieved. Focused ion beam (FIB)
   cross section imaging measurements revealed that silver nanoparticles
   penetrated the paper surface to a depth of more than 1 mu m, resulting
   in highly stable coatings. The coated paper demonstrated antibacterial
   activity against E. coli and S. aureus, suggesting its potential
   application as a food packing material for longer shelf life.

AB Plasmonic excitations in a three interacting nanocylinder cluster have
   been investigated by both simple analytical modeling and discrete
   dipole approximation (DDA) calculations. In our analytical model, each
   cylinder is regarded as an anisotropic electric dipole with four
   parameters determined by fitting its optical extinction and scattering
   spectra to that of DDA simulation. Diagonalization of our analytical
   model for the three interacting dipoles reveals 10 significant plasmon
   modes, namely, 5 bright modes and 5 dark eigen-modes. Because of rather
   long-range longitudinal plasmon coupling, the resonant energies of the
   two longitudinal modes vary pronouncedly with the intercylinder
   distance even when the intercylinder distance is about 25 times larger
   than the cylinder diameter. In contrast, for the transverse modes the
   splitting of resonant energies becomes apparent when the intercylinder
   distance falls within about five times of the cylinder diameter.
   Interestingly, for sufficiently large clusters, each resonance peak
   contains both magnetic dipole (M1) and electric quadrupole (E2) as well
   as electric dipole (E1) contributions, and these multipole
   contributions become rather visible ("bright") when the distance
   between the two neighboring cylinders is sufficiently reduced. Finally,
   the optical plasmon excitation spectra from our simple analytical model
   are in good qualitative agreement with our DDA calculations.

   characterized by means of transmission electron microscopy,

   from the environmental degradation by providing a barrier against
   oxidation and ensures stability of the ferromagnetic core metal inside

AB We have evaluated the key properties of the polyethylenimine
   (PEI)-polyethylene glycol (PEG)-TAT peptide polyplex nanoparticles
   including their behavior in cells and compared them with the
   transfection efficacy (TE) using 11 different cell lines. We found
   statistically significant positive correlation between TE and the share
   of 50-75 nm fraction in the whole mixture of nanoparticles estimated
   with atomic force microscopy. Variations in PEG/PEI and N/P ratios (PEI
   nitrogen to DNA phosphate ratio) enabled us to find their optimal
   combinations, which resulted in up to 100% TE for several cell lines.
   Surfaces of the TE dependence of both PEG/PEI and N/P turned out to be
   similar in appearance for all investigated cell lines, while maximum
   TEs were different. We investigated subcellular transport kinetics and
   unpacking of the polyplex nanoparticles labeled with quantum dots
   (plasmid DNA) and AlexaFluor647 (block-copolymer part) using Forster
   Resonance Energy Transfer approach. The results demonstrated clear and
   statistically significant positive correlation of TE with the cellular
   uptake rate of the nanoparticles and negative correlation with the rate
   constant of their unpacking within endo/lysosomal compartments in the
   living cells.

AB A new method of gold concentration with a total enrichment factor of
   104 has been developed. The method includes a liquid-liquid extraction
   of [image omitted] by reverse micelles; reduction of gold (III) to Au
   nanoparticles (with hydrazine monohydrate as a reducing agent) in the
   extracts and an electrophoretic concentration of the particles in a
   cell with parallel-plane electrodes. With increasing sodium sulfate
   concentration in the feed there was a decrease of water content for
   ordinary micelles and an increase of gold extraction. At a constant
   acid-salt background (3mol/L HCl+3.5mol/L Na2SO4) concentration, AOT
   introduction into micelles led to a decrease in extraction. The
   obtained regularities are consistent with a hydrate-solvate mechanism.
   The electrophoretic mobility of gold nanoparticles in extracts has been
   determined. When AOT was introduced into the extracts after the stage
   of reduction the electrophoretic mobility of nanoparticles was
   considerably increased (from -1.8x10-11 to 1.8x10-10m2/(Vxs)) which
   made possible an additional stage of electrophoretic concentration with
   an enrichment factor of 1.5x103.

DE culture medium; silver nanoparticles; silicon nitride substrate
AB We studied stability of complexes of silver nanoparticles and silicon
   nitride before and after their interaction with liquid media and after
   passing through bacterial filters. According to scanning electron
   microscopy data, contact with fluids and passage through bacterial
   filters reduced the content of silver nanoparticles in complexes
   compared to that in initial complexes. It was shown that these
   differences depended on both initial characteristics of the examined
   samples and the used liquid media. The complex Ag/Si3N4 obtained after
   5 silver reduction cycles and containing 15% alpha- and 85%
   beta-modifications of silicon nitride (sample No. 2) was characterized
   by maximum stability. Culture medium produced more aggressive effect on
   stability of the studied complexes. We concluded that the effect of
   culture media on stability of silver nanoparticles-silicon nitride
   complexes depends on phase composition of the substrate and method of
   application of silver nanoparticles.

   CuCl was deposited as nanoparticle arrays whose size and density were
   controlled by the process conditions. The nanoparticles were deposited
   using the self-limiting reaction of [bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene]
   -(hexafluoroacetylacetonato)-copper(I) and hydrogen chloride. UV
   absorption measurements showed the characteristic Z(1,2) and Z(3)
   exciton absorption bands of CuCl. A strong UV emission was observed at
   5 K from the free exciton Z(3) and bound exciton I-1 at 386.7 and 390.6
   nm, respectively. A previously unreported visible emission band at 408
   nm was also observed and attributed to the acceptor level of Cu

   (Co86Nb12Ta2) (x) (SiO (n) )(100 - x) has been performed in the

   thermomagnetic dependences in the range 4.2-300 K and the processes of
   magnetization reversal and remanent magnetization relaxation at
   liquid-helium temperatures have been studied. It has been established
   that the average anisotropy constants of amorphous nanograins are equal
   to 3.6-7.0 kJ/m(3) for the (Co41Fe39B20) (x) (SiO (n) )(100 - x)
   composites and 5-8 kJ/m(3) for the (Co86Nb12Ta2) (x) (SiO (n) )(100 -
   x) composites. The fundamental differences in the concentration
   dependences of the anisotropy constant K (eff) and the coercive force H
   (C) have been revealed for the two systems under investigation. It has
   been demonstrated that, as the concentration of the metal phase
   increases, the quantities K (eff) and H (C) increase for the
   (Co86Nb12Ta2) (x) (SiO (n) )(100 - x) composites and decrease for the

AB A method in which the water-soluble complex [Au(NH3)(4)](NO3)(3) is
   used as the active-component precursor is suggested for preparing
   nanosized Au/C catalysts (C = Sibunit, a mesoporous carbon material).
   The complex is unreadily reducible by the carbon matrix and can be
   involved in cation exchange with proton-containing groups of the
   support. This method is referred to as cationic adsorption. It has been
   demonstrated by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy,
   and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy that the catalyst prepared in this
   way and treated with H-2 at 400A degrees C contains size-uniform gold
   metal particles with a dominant diameter of < 5 nm. The greater part of
   the gold particles is located on the outer surface of the Sibunit
   granules; that is, an egg shell type distribution of the active
   component takes place. The catalyst containing 1.3 wt % Au shows high
   activity in CO oxidation with excess humid air at 40A degrees C. In
   this respect, it is far superior to the Au/C catalysts prepared by
   conventional methods (deposition-precipitation and impregnation), in
   which the typical gold particle size is several tens of nanometers.

AB The possibility to conduct the experiment on small-angle neutron
   scattering on very dilute magnetic fluids (the volume fraction of
   magnetite is similar to 0.1%) is discussed. The aim of these
   experiments is to determine the structural parameters of these fluids
   using the Guinier approximation. Primary attention is concentrated on
   the experimental observation of a nonmagnetic layer on the surfaces of
   magnetic nanoparticles dispersed in a liquid carrier. Significant
   parameters are determined, and conditions for the experiment on the
   contrast variation are chosen in model calculations.

AB The behavior of a (SiO2)(325) nanoparticle constructed by icosahedral
   packing of identical blocks and subjected to uniform tension has been
   investigated using the molecular dynamics method. In the nanoparticle,
   the middle layers are characterized by the largest oscillations of the
   internal pressure and potential energy. As the strain increases, the
   number of neighboring silicon ions decreases and reaches a constant
   value of four at the strain Delta l/l = 0.10. With an increase in the
   strain, the surface tension of the nanoparticle decreases and passes
   through a minimum at Delta l/l = 0.16.

AB Reactive diffusion of hydrogen in copper-doped glasses has been
   analyzed, and the formation of copper nanoparticles via reduction of
   ionic copper has been numerically modelled. Simulated optical
   properties of glass-copper nanocomposites are compared with measured
   optical spectroscopy data, which demonstrated the resonance of optical
   absorption corresponding to surface plasmon resonance (SPR) in copper
   (similar to 560 nm) nanoparticles. These samples were used in
   femtosecond self induced nonlinear transmission and pump-probe
   transmission measurements in the vicinity of the SPR. In pump-probe
   experiments bleaching of the samples due to the surface plasmon
   damping, as high as Delta T/T-15% with 8.7 ps relaxation time, was
   observed. Transmission measurements showed reverse saturable absorption
   with a nonlinear absorption coefficient of 10(-10)-10(-9) cm/W in
   copper-doped nanocomposite that corresponded to similar to 30% light
   induced change in the absorption coefficient. The observed record
   picosecond SPR bleaching and reverse saturable absorption make
   glass-copper nanocomposites attractive for nonlinear optical
   applications.

   nanoparticle covered with a water layer is formed after the inclusion

   of IR and Raman spectra lowers after the absorption of H2O molecules by
   the cluster. The power of IR radiation emitted by the cluster increases
   nonmonotonically with the addition of water molecules to the cluster.
   The absorption of water molecules by the cluster leads to a significant
   increase in the absorption coefficient and only a slight increase in
   the refractive index. The number of electrons participating in the
   interaction with electromagnetic radiation increases with the addition

ID PARTICLES; SURFACE
AB A theoretical model is proposed for describing the melting of a metal
   nanoparticle embedded into a solid matrix. The model is based on a
   thermodynamic approach that takes into account matrix elasticity. The
   melting process is described for gold nanoparticles embedded in a solid
   matrix whose elastic modulus is varied in a wide range. Both spherical
   and ellipsoidal particles are considered. It is shown that particle
   melting temperature can be both higher and lower than the melting point
   of a bulk sample depending on the interaction intensity of the solid
   and liquid particle surfaces with the matrix. An increase in the shear
   modulus of the matrix causes a rise in the nanoparticle melting
   temperature, with the effect of the matrix elasticity becoming
   noticeable at some critical shear modulus. The conditions are revealed
   at which only a surface layer of a nanoparticle, the thickness of which
   depends on the particle radius and temperature, is melted.

   with the atomic ratio Pt : Cu approximate to 7 : 3 is observed. The

   regards the adsorption of hydrogen and copper atoms and the specific

AB Iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs) with a diameter of 21.6 nm were coated
   with poly(maleic acid-alt-1-octadecene) (PMAcOD) modified with grafted
   5000 Da poly(ethyelene glycol) (PEG) or short ethylene glycol (EG)
   tails. The coating procedure utilizes hydrophobic interactions of
   octadecene and oleic acid tails, while the hydrolysis of maleic
   anhydride moieties as well as the presence of hydrophilic PEG (EG)
   tails allows the NP hydrophilicity. The success of the NP coating was
   found to be independent of the degree of grafting, which was varied
   between 20 and 80% of the -MacOD- units, but depended on the length of
   the grafted tail. The NP coating and hydrophilization did not occur
   when the modified copolymer contained 750 Da PEG tails independent of
   the grafting degree. To explain this phenomenon, the micellization of
   the modified PMAcOD copolymers in water was analyzed by small-angle
   X-ray scattering. The PMAcOD molecules with the grafted 750 Da PEG
   tails form compact noninteracting disklike micelles, whose stability
   apparently allows for no interactions with the NP hydrophobic shells.
   The PMAcOD containing the 5000 Da PEG and EG tails form much larger
   structures capable of an efficient coating of the NPs. The coated NPs
   were characterized using transmission electron microscopy, dynamic
   light scattering, zeta-potential measurements, and thermal gravimetry
   analysis. The latter method demonstrated that the presence of long PEG
   tails in modified PMAcOD allows the attachment of fewer macromolecules
   (by a factor of similar to 20) compared with the case of nonmodified or
   EG-modified PMAcOD, emphasizing the importance of PEG tails in NP
   hydrophilization. The NPs coated with PMAcOD modified with 60% (toward
   all -MAcOD- units) of the 5000 PEG tails bear a significant negative
   charge and display good stability in buffers. Such NPs can be useful as
   magnetic cores for virus-like particle formation.

AB Aqueous solutions of iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs) stabilized by
   poly(maleic acid-alt-1-octadecene) (PMAcOD) modified with the 5000 Da
   poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) or the short ethylene glycol (EG) tails
   were analyzed by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Advanced SAXS
   data analysis methods were employed to systematically characterize the
   structure and interactions between the NPs. Depending on the type of
   the grafted tail and the grafting density, all NPs can be separated
   into three groups. All the samples contain mixtures of individual
   nanoparticles, their dynamic clusters, and aggregates, and the
   fractions of these species are different in the different groups. The
   first group consists of NPs coated with PMAcOD modified with the long
   PEG tails with the maximal grafting density, and the content of dynamic
   clusters and aggregates in the samples of this group does not exceed
   4%. The samples from the second group with less dense coatings
   demonstrate a larger amount (5-7%) of the aggregates and dynamic
   clusters. The samples from the third group, consisting of the NPs
   protected by EG-modified PMAcOD, contain mostly individual NPs and some
   amount of dumbbell dimers without noticeable aggregation. Importantly,
   the solution behavior of the NPs is independent of the iron oxide core
   size. Our results, therefore, provide means of predicting the
   stabilization and avoiding aggregation of NPs based on the type of
   protective shell.

AB Using the valence-to-core version of X-ray emission spectroscopy
   (valence-to-core XES) together with X-ray diffraction analysis, the
   structure and the composition of nickel coatings deposited from
   solutions containing hypophosphite ions or dimethylaminoborane (DMAB)
   are studied. The diffraction patterns of prepared deposits are
   characterized by the presence of a wide "halo". Annealing of
   crystallographically amorphous deposits at temperatures of 500A degrees
   C and higher transforms these haloes into the spectra corresponding to
   metal nickel and its phosphides or borides present in the crystallized
   deposits. A result of fundamental importance obtained in the
   simultaneously conducted examination of the same deposits by the
   valence-to-core XES method is that both the binding energy and the
   intensities of K beta satellite spectral lines of annealed samples
   remain unchanged as compared with original samples. Based on this
   comparison, it is concluded that phosphide and boride nickel compounds
   were already formed in the course of electrodeposition, whereas the
   thermal treatment of deposits (crystallization) leads only to
   aggregation of the metal and metal-metalloid nanoparticles.

AB Composites of functionalized single-wall carbon nanotubes and
   polyaniline are deposited onto electrodes by in situ electrochemical
   polymerization. Their electrochemical behavior and differential
   capacitance are studied by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy, and chronovoltamperometry. The differential
   capacitance of the composite electrode exceeds that of pure polyaniline
   film deposited onto electrode, which can be explained by the nanotubes'
   loosening effect on the polyaniline structure. The composite-electrode
   capacitance is as large as 1000 F g(-1) or higher. Thus obtained
   composite films were used as a support for deposited platinum-ruthenium
   catalyst. The Pt-Ru structure and catalytic properties in the methanol
   oxidation reaction are studied. It is shown that the specific current
   of methanol oxidation at Pt-Ru is larger by a factor of 7-15 than those
   measured when pure polyaniline, pure carbon nanotubes, or standard
   Vulcan XC-72 carbon black are used as supports. It is found that the
   catalytic activity is the same for all studied supports, provided the
   current is reduced to the unit of Pt-Ru true surface area. Thus, the
   observed large catalytic effect is associated with the structure and
   high dispersivity of the electrodeposited metals incorporated to the
   single-wall carbon nanotubes-polyaniline composite.

   sieves with nanoparticles of ferroelastic LiCsSO4 within pores were
   carried out. The critical softening of the transverse ultrasound

AB The review discusses the advances and problems in biotechnology and

   genetic and microbiological techniques in this field. Due to the ease
   of cultivation, high growth rate, availability of synchronous cultures,
   and existence of numerous molecular genetic and microbiological
   techniques for various cyanobacterial strains,
   cyanobacteria-prokaryotic organisms that are ancient relatives of the
   chloroplasts-are model organisms in the studies of photosynthesis,
   dinitrogen fixation, cell division, hydrogen production, and in a
   number of other areas of basic and applied science. These techniques
   make possible deeper understanding of the role of cyanobacteria in
   various ecosystems and utilization of their potential in numerous
   applied projects, including production of molecular hydrogen,
   phycobiliproteins, and cyanophycin; formation of nanoparticles; removal
   of heavy metals from the environment; substrate biodegradation;
   manufacture of products for medicine and food industry; and solution of
   the problem of cyanobacterial toxins in freshwater and marine

AB The particle-size distribution, electrooptical potential, and acid
   properties of the surface of Al2O3 nanoparticles in aqueous media were
   studied by dynamic light scattering, electroacoustic spectral analysis,
   and potentiometric titration. The nanopowder with the mean particle
   size 22 nm was obtained by the oxidation of aluminum wire in the vapor
   phase using electrical explosion in oxygen-argon mixture. In spite of
   the presence of aggregates, aqueous suspensions of nanoparticles, as
   distinct from suspensions of micropowders, are stable without the
   addition of special stabilizers because of the spontaneous formation of
   a double electrical layer on their surface, the electrokinetic
   potential of which is positive and exceeds 30 mV. The most probable
   reason for electrostatic self-stabilization of suspensions of
   nanopowders is the adsorption of Al ions formed in the hydrolysis of
   aluminum nitrates, small amounts of which are produced in electrical
   discharges during preparation.

AB Heats of adsorption Q of n-alkanes C-6-C-9 on ZrO2 modified with gold
   and nickel nanoparticles were determined experimentally. The Q values
   were found to be higher on average by 7 kJ/mol on the modified samples
   as compared to the pure support. Density functional theory with the PBE
   functional and the pseudopotential for gold effectively allowing for
   relativistic corrections was used to model the adsorption of saturated
   hydrocarbons on Au and Au + Ni, as exemplified by the interaction of
   alkanes C-1-C-3 with Au (m) , Au Nim - 1 (m = 3, 4, 5) clusters as well
   as the interaction of C-1-C-8 with Au-20. Based on the calculation
   results, the probable coordination centers of alkanes on nanoparticle
   surfaces were found to be vertices and edges, whereas face localization
   was less probable.

AB Fe3O4 nanoparticles were coated with a layer of citric acid, forming
   coordination bonds between citrate ions and iron ions. The resulting
   aqueous citrate ferrite colloid was used as a T-2-weighted MRI negative
   contrasting agent. Sequential i.v. doses of citrate ferrite and
   Magnevist led to increases in MRI image contrast for 40 h and
   brightness for 30 min; scanning using a Bruker Biospec BC 70/30 USR
   biospectrotomograph yielded enhanced MRI images. This enhancement of
   MRI images was used to monitor oncogenesis during magnetohydrodynamic
   thermochemotherapy (MT) of mammary adenocarcinoma Ca 755 in female
   C57Bl/6j mice. Dextran ferrite colloid containing cyclophosphamide was
   tested as a magnetically directed antitumor agent using MT. Treatment
   of non-infiltrating tumors of volume approximate to 30 mm(3) with six
   sessions of MT each lasting 30 min at 46 degrees C led to 40% tumor
   regression and 300% increases in survival time. Treatment of
   infiltrating tumors of volume approximate to 300 mm(3) in the same

AB The possibility of the giant enhancement of hyper-Raman scattering by
   molecules adsorbed on rough metal surfaces is demonstrated. The theory
   is based on the qualitative consideration of electromagnetic field
   enhancement near some model rough surfaces and individual
   irregularities, as well as on the quantum-mechanical features of dipole
   and quadrupole interactions of light with molecules (as in the theory
   of surface-enhanced Raman scattering), proposed by the author. A
   consideration of symmetric molecules makes it possible to obtain
   selection rules for surface-enhanced hyper-Raman scattering (SEHRS)
   spectra and establish such a regularity as the occurrence of strong
   forbidden lines (which are due to totally symmetric vibrations); these
   lines are transformed according to unitary irreducible representation
   in molecules with the symmetry groups C-nh, D, and higher. An analysis
   of the data in the literature for trans-1,2-bis (4-pyridyl) ethylene
   and pyridine molecules shows that their spectra can be explained in
   terms of the dipole-quadrupole theory of SEHRS. At the same time, the
   analysis of the SEHRS spectra of pyrazine revealed the presence of
   strong forbidden bands due to totally symmetric vibrations. This
   finding substantiated the proposed theory, which makes it possible to
   interpret the entire spectrum in detail. These results are in good
   agreement with the general mechanism of the optical effects enhanced by
   molecules adsorbed on metal surfaces, which was developed by the author.

AB The optical properties of solutions of endometallofullerenes with
   lanthanides (Gd@C-82, Ce@C-82, La@C-82, Y@C-82) in dimethylformamide
   are studied. It is found that these solutions luminesce in the visible
   region. This luminescence is accompanied by enhanced Raman scattering.
   It is suggested that these processes are related to nanoplasmon
   excitations in clusters of endometallofullerenes. It is shown that the
   luminescence spectrum is described by a superposition of three to four
   Gaussian spectral profiles, whose energy positions and intensities
   nonmonotonically depend on the energy of excitation quanta. A detailed
   quantitative dependence of the intensity and shape of the Raman
   scattering signal on the concentration of endometallofullerenes in the
   solutions is determined. Comparative measurements are performed for the
   emission spectra of solutions of simple fullerenes and
   chromatographically pure endometallofullerenes. Complex investigations
   show that the visible luminescence and Raman scattering enhancement are
   only observed in the case of the formation of nanosized anionic
   complexes of endometallofullerenes in the solution.

   were done on multilayer samples with Fe thicknesses of 2-6 angstrom and
   chromium spacer thicknesses of 10 and 20 angstrom. The samples were
   prepared by molecular beam epitaxy. The static magnetization and
   complex magnetic susceptibility were measured and FMR spectra taken. It
   was found that, depending on the thickness of the Fe layers and
   temperature, different magnetic phases are realized in the system:
   supermagnetism, magnetic ordering, and a nonergodic state characterized
   by a dependence of the magnetization of a sample on its magnetic
   prehistory. The observed nonergodic phase is found to exhibit spin
   glass properties. A qualitative phase diagram of the magnetic states of
   this system is constructed. (c) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

AB Metal atom clusters constitute very promising candidates as
   luminophores for applications in biotechnology because they are
   nanosized entities offering robust luminescence in the near-infrared
   field (NI R). However, they cannot be used as prepared for biological
   applications because of potential toxic effects and quenching of the
   clusters' luminescence in aqueous media, and they therefore need to be
   dispersed in a biocompatible matrix. We describe herein the
   encapsulation of octahedral rhenium clusters, denoted as
   A(4)[Re(6)Q(8)L(6)] (A = Cs or K, Q = S or Se, and L = OH or CN), in
   silica nanoparticles by a water-in-oil microemulsion process, paying
   particular attention to the clusters' stability. The obtained
   A(4)[Re(6)Q(8)L(6)]SiO2 nanoparticles are 30 nm in size with good
   monodispersity and a perfectly spherical shape, as shown by scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM). The presence of cluster units inside the
   silica matrix was evidenced by scanning transmission electron
   microscopy in annular dark-field mode (A DF-STEM). From the point of
   view of their optical properties., the A(4)[Re(6)Q(8)L(6)]@SiO2
   nanoparticles show red and NI R emission under UV excitation, even when
   dispersed in water. The evolution of the structural and luminescence
   properties of clusters before and after encapsulation was followed by
   Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopy.

AB The condensation of 85000 Cu or Ni atoms from the high-temperature gas
   phase has been simulated by molecular dynamics with the tight binding
   potential. The efect of the subsequent thermal treatment on the shape
   and structure of synthesized particles was studied by simulating their
   gradual heating in a range of 100-1200 K. Some tendencies are revealed
   that are characteristic of the influence of heat treatment on the
   nanoparticles synthesized from the gas phase. It is concluded that
   short-term heating leads to significant ordering of the internal
   structure in 70% of agglomerated nanoparticles with the predominant
   formation of spherical shapes. In order to explain this result, the
   main mechanisms of cluster formation from the gas phase have been
   analyzed and it is found that the agglomeration temperature plays the
   main role in the formation of clusters with unified shape and
   structure. This opens the fundamental possibility of obtaining Cu and
   Ni nanoclusters with preset size, shape, and structure and, hence,
   predictable physical properties.

AB A method for the continuous-flow fractionation of particles in a
   transverse centrifugal field in a rotating conoidal coiled (RCC) column
   has been developed. A model of a planetary centrifuge with a conoidal
   drum of a special construction has been tested. The effects of the
   rotation and revolution speed of the conoidal RCC, as well as the
   direction and pumping rate of the mobile phase on the behavior of
   particles smaller than 1 mu m have been studied. The conditions have
   been selected and optimized for the retention and elution of spherical
   particles of the '150 nm', '400 nm', and '900 nm' standard samples of
   silica gel (Polyscience Inc.). The possibility of using RCC for the
   analysis and production of monodisperse standard particle samples has
   been demonstrated. In particular, the '900 nm' particles have been
   separated from admixtures of small (100-200 nm) particles and
   nonspherical 1-2 mu m particles present in the sample. The separated
   fractions have been characterized by electron microscopy.

AB A theory of low-threshold optical nonlinearity in dielectric
   nanocomposites, which describes features of the nonlinear response of
   samples in weak laser radiation fields, is proposed for the first time.
   It is shown that the experimentally observed low-threshold nonlinear
   response and its unusual character of variation with increasing
   radiation intensity are related to the photoinduced dipole electric
   moments of nanoparticles, the dependence of the differential population
   of states of charge carriers in a nanoparticle on the radiation
   intensity, and the orientation of nanoparticles along the direction of
   polarization in the external optical field.

AB Lead sulfide (PbS) crystals with sizes from 20 to 500 nm were deposited
   in chemical bath from an alkaline solution (CBD method). The morphology
   of specimens was studied using high resolution scanning electron
   microscopy (HRSEM). Influence of crystallite sizes on the electronic
   structure was studied with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and
   high resolution electrons energy losses spectroscopy (HREELS). The work
   function was measured with a Kelvin probe microscopy in air.
   The photoelectron doublet peaks at spectra of Pb 4f donor and S 2p
   acceptor were found to be shifted toward the higher binding energies
   comparing to the corresponding lines positions in the reference PbS
   compound. This shift increases with decreasing of the crystals size.
   The effect of size shift in lead sulfide could be noticed when size is
   smaller than 300 nm. HREELS showed that dispersion of nanoparticles
   causes smoothing of the PbS band gap in different directions of
   reciprocal lattice, and the minimal transition energy increases from
   0.39 to 3.62 eV. The work function of the material is shown to be in
   inverse proportion to the semiconductor crystal size. This data
   correlates well with the electron spectroscopy results.

AB The processes of local magnetization reversal of elliptic Co/Si/Co
   nanodisks under the action of a nonuniform magnetic field of a
   magnetic-force microscope (MFM) probe have been investigated. The
   specific features of the distribution of the phase MFM contrast from
   particles with ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic configurations of
   the magnetic moments in neighboring Co layers have been discussed. It
   has been shown experimentally that, under the action of the probe
   field, there occur orientational transitions of two types: transitions
   from the ferromagnetic configuration to the antiferromagnetic
   configuration due to the reorientation of the magnetization of the
   upper layer and transitions in the antiferromagnetic configuration with
   a change in the orientation of the magnetic moment in both
   ferromagnetic layers. The presented results of micromagnetic simulation
   of the processes of transformation of the magnetization in such
   particles under the action of the MFM probe field explain the main
   regularities of the magnetization reversal processes.

AB The dynamic properties of photons in photonic crystals as classical

   waves, corresponding to the two lowest branches, has been analysed. The
   expression for photonic mass was obtained. Positive and negative values
   of photon mass were found. At some spectral regions the photon mass
   value essentially increases. Taking into account resonance states due
   to dielectric or metal nanoparticles embedded into globular photonic
   crystal pores, heavy photons with very low velocities may exist.
   Experimental results for three-dimensional photonic crystals' optical

AB Oxidation of bulk samples of (Al) by water and H2O/CO2 mixture at sub-
   and supercritical conditions for uniform temperature increase and at
   the injection of H2O (665 K, 23.1 MPa) and H2O/CO2 (723 K. 38.0 MPa)
   fluids into the reactor has been studied. Transition of (Al) into AlOOH
   and Al2O3 nanoparticles has been found out. Aluminum samples oxidized
   by H2O and H2O/CO2 fluids at the injection mostly consist of large
   particles (300-500 nm) of alpha-Al2O3. Those oxidized for uniform
   temperature increase contain smaller particles (20-70 nm) of
   gamma-Al2O3 as well. Mechanism of this phenomenon is explained by
   orientation of oxygen in H2O polar molecules to the metal in the
   electric field of contact voltage at Al/AlOOH and Al/Al2O3 boundary.
   Addition of CO2 to water resulted in CO, CH4, CH3OH and condensed
   carbon, increase in size of Al/Al2O3 nanoparticles and significant
   decrease in time delay. In pure CO2 (Al) oxidation resulted in oxide
   film. Using temperature and time dependences of gaseous reactant
   pressure and Redlich-Kwong state equation, kinetics of H-2 formation
   has been described and oxidation regularities determined. At aluminum
   oxidation by H2O and H2O/CO2 fluids, self-heating of the samples
   followed by oxidation rate increase has been registered. The samples of
   oxidized aluminum have been studied with a transmission electronic
   microscope, a thermal analyzer and a device for specific surface
   measurement. The effect of oxidation conditions on the characteristics
   of synthesized nanoparticles has been found out. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

   22.5K(2)O-22.5Al(2)O(3)-55B(2)O(3) co-doped with low concentrations of
   Fe2O3 and MnO. In as-prepared samples the paramagnetic ions, as a rule,
   are in diluted state. However, in the case where the ratio of the iron
   and manganese oxides in the charge is 3/2, magnetic nanoparticles with
   characteristics close to those of manganese ferrite are formed already
   at the first stage of the glass preparation, as evidenced by both
   magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) and EMR. After thermal treatment all
   glasses show characteristic MCD and EMR spectra, attesting to the
   presence of magnetic nanoparticles, predominantly including iron ions.
   Preliminary EXAFS measurements at the Fe K-absorption edge show an
   emergence of nanoparticles with a structure close to MnFe2O4 after
   annealing the glasses at 560 degrees C.
   By computer simulating the EMR spectra at variable temperatures, a
   superparamagnetic nature of relatively broad size and shape
   distribution with the average diameter of ca. 3-4 nm. The
   characteristic temperature-dependent shift of the apparent resonance
   field is explained by a strong temperature dependence of the magnetic
   anisotropy in the nanoparticles.
   The formation of magnetic nanoparticles confers to the
   potassium-alumina-borate glasses magnetic and magneto-optical
   properties typical of magnetically ordered substances. At the same
   time, they remain transparent in a part of the visible and near
   infrared spectral range and display a high Faraday rotation value. (C)

DE Uranium oxides; Nanoparticles; Uranyl nitrate; Supported catalyst; XPS;

AB Synthesis of alumina-supported uranium oxide catalysts and their
   characterization in methane oxidation have been performed The catalysts
   containing 5% U were prepared by impregnation solid-phase synthesis and
   mechanical mixing techniques Samples were studied using BET XRD HRTEM
   and XPS methods It was shown that physicochemical properties and
   activity of the catalysts depend on the preparation procedure and
   calcination temperature and are determined by the extent of the
   interaction between active component and support Most active are the
   catalysts prepared by impregnation of alumina with an aqueous solution
   of uranyl nitrate It was found that the 5%U/Al2O3 catalyst calcined at
   1000 C has the highest catalytic activity and it is explained by the
   formation of highly active nanodispersed state of uranium on the

AB A highly transparent ceramic has been synthesized from Nd3+:Y2O3 to
   which 6 mol. % ZrO2 and 25 mol. % Sc2O3 or Lu2O3 were added for
   disordering the crystal structure. Nanopowders with an average particle
   size of 10-15 nm served as an initial material. They were compacted by
   the method of uniaxial static pressing combined with ultrasonic action
   on nanoparticles. The compacting pressure was 200 MPa; the power of the
   ultrasonic generator was 1.5 kW. It has been shown that the replacement
   of Y by isovalent Sc and Lu ions and by heterovalent Zr ions reduces
   the content of pores and the sizes of crystallites. The transparency of
   the Nd3+:Y2O3 ceramic with these additives reaches a maximum of 82.2%,

AB The problem of extreme focusing of an optical beam into the spatial
   region with wavelength dimensions is considered with the use of the
   special features of radiation interaction with isolated spherical
   particles. Results of numerical computations of the optical field
   intensity at the surface of silver particles of different radii upon
   exposure to laser radiation with different wavelengths are presented.
   It is demonstrated that the relative intensity of the plasmon optical
   field on the nanoparticle surface increases and the field focusing
   region decreases with increasing particle radius. Results of numerical
   computations illustrating the influence of the shell of composite
   nanoparticles comprising a dielectric core and a metal shell on the
   optical field intensity in the vicinity of the particle are presented.
   The problem of local optical foci of a transparent microparticle
   (photonic nanojets) is investigated. It is established that variation
   of the micron particle size, its optical properties, and laser
   radiation parameters allows the amplitude and spatial characteristics
   of the photonic nanojet region to be controlled efficiently.

AB Carbon-encapsulated Ni and Cu nanoparticles with a core/shell structure
   were synthesized by levitational gas condensation (LGC). Methane (CH4)
   gas was used to coat the surface of the Ni and Cu nanoparticles. The Ni
   particles had a core diameter of 10 nm, and were covered by 2-3 nm thin
   carbon layers. In the case of Cu, the particles had a core diameter of
   30 nm, and multi-shells with a thickness of 2-3 nm. Biginelli reaction
   in the presence of l-proline and Ni encapsulated nanoparticles was
   carried out to change the ratio between stereoisomers in favor of the
   S-enantiomer for 3,4-dihydropyrimidine (DHPM) with an excess of about
   18%.

ID STONER-WOHLFARTH MODEL; HYPERTHERMIA; FIELD; TIME
AB On the basis of Brown's kinetic equation a consistent study of the
   regimes of cyclic magnetization reversal of single-domain particles
   with a uniaxial anisotropy is performed. The applied field is harmonic
   and linearly polarized, its amplitude equals the maximal coercive force
   of a Stoner-Wohlfarth particle. The dynamic magnetic hysteresis loops
   are obtained for a particle (oriented particle ensemble), whose
   easy-magnetization axis is tilted to the field direction under an
   arbitrary angle. It is shown that the Stoner-Wohlfarth regime (often
   termed as quasistatic) is able to describe the behavior of a
   nanoparticle only in a quite limited material and external parameter
   range. The developed approach has at least two major merits: it enables
   one to consider dynamic magnetic hysteresis in the
   temperature-frequency domains inaccessible with the aid of approximate
   methods, and provides a tool to test the accuracy of the latter.

AB The light-induced insulator-to-metal phase transition was investigated
   by femtosecond pump-probe techniques in nanocrystalline VO2 films. The
   size of VO2 nanoparticles and the VO2 film morphology were found to be
   critical for the ultrafast light-induced phase-transition dynamics.
   Experimental measurements of the third-order nonlinear susceptibility
   chi((3)) for the insulating phase at different excitation levels and
   transient grating experiments show a size-dependent threshold behavior
   which is related to the light-induced transition process. Optical
   properties of VO2 nanoparticles, vertical bar chi((3))vertical bar
   data, and transition dynamics at subnanosecond time scale also
   demonstrate a pronounced size dependence. The rate of structural phase
   transition increases due to confinement effect as particle size
   decreases. Nucleation of the metallic phase shows a critical behavior
   with formation of a metastable state in VO2. A kinetic model for the
   metallic phase growth and transient grating signal evolution upon
   ultrafast laser excitation is developed for VO2 thin film.

   of the hydrocarbon carotenoid beta-carotene leads to enhanced yield of
   the reactive hydroxyl (OH) radicals The electron paramagnetic resonance
   (EPR) spin-trapping technique using a phenyl N-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN)
   as the spin-trap has been applied to detect this intermediate by
   trapping the methyl and methoxy radicals generated upon reaction of the
   hydroxyl radical with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) The free radicals formed
   in this system proceed via oxygen reduction and not via the reaction of
   holes on the TiO2 surface As compared with pure carotenoids
   carotenoid-arabinogalactan complexes exhibit an enhanced quantum yield
   of free radicals and stability toward photodegradation The observed
   enhancement of the photocatalytic efficiency for carotenoid complexes
   as measured by the quantum yield of the desired spin adducts arises
   specifically from the decrease in the rate constant for the back
   electron transfer to the carotenoid radical cation These results are
   Important for a variety of TiO2 applications namely in photodynamic
   therapy and in the design of artificial light-harvesting, photoredox,
   and catalytic devices

   encapsulated in a carbon shell were carried out. It was found that
   oxidation of the copper nanoparticles starts at a temperature of 200 A
   degrees C. The formation of oxide phases occurs on the surface of the
   carbon shells, with the Cu2O phase appearing first followed by the
   formation of the CuO phase. Upon heating to just below its melting
   point, the copper sublimes resulting in the formation of hollow carbon
   nanocapsules. Treatment of the initial or oxidized encapsulated copper
   nanoparticles with nitric acid and annealing can be used to obtain

   using the molecular dynamics method. The 73-atom particles have a
   crystal structure, a random atomic packing, and a packing formed by
   inserting a 13-atom icosahedron into a 60-atom fullerene. They are
   surrounded by a "coat" from 60 atoms of hydrogen. The nanoassembled
   particle at the presence of a hydrogen "coat" has the most stable
   number (close to four) of Si-Si bonds per atom. The structure and
   kinetic properties of a hollow single-layer fullerene-structured Si-60
   cluster are considered in the temperature range 10 K a parts per
   thousand currency sign T a parts per thousand currency sign 1760 K.
   Five series of calculations are conducted, with a simulation of several
   media inside and outside the Si-60 cluster, specifically, the vacuum
   and interior spaces filled with 30 and 60 hydrogen atoms with and
   without the exterior hydrogen environment of 60 atoms. Fullerene
   surrounded by a hydrogen "coat" and containing 60 hydrogen atoms in the
   interior space has a higher stability. Such cluster has smaller
   self-diffusion coefficients at high temperatures. The fullerene
   stabilized with hydrogen is stable to the formation of linear atomic
   chains up to the temperatures 270-280 K.

   sentinel lymph nodes) and conventionally-stained tissues. In addition,
   we introduced a spectral burning technique for histology through
   selective laser bleaching areas with nondesired absorption background
   and nanobubble-based PT signal amplification. The obtained data
   demonstrated the promise of PT cytometry in the analysis of
   low-absorption samples and mapping of various individual nanoparticles'
   distribution that would be impossible with existing assays. Comparison
   of PT cytometry and photoacoustic (PA) cytometry previously developed
   by us, revealed that these methods supplement each other with a
   sensitivity advantage (up to 10-fold) of contactless PT technique in
   assessment of thin (<= 100 mu m) histological samples, while PA imaging
   provides characterization of thicker samples which, however, requires
   an acoustic contact with transducers. A potential of high-speed
   integrated PT-PA cytometry for express histology and
   immunohistochemistry of both intact and stained heterogeneous tissues
   with high sensitivity at the zepromolar concentration level is further
   highlighted. (C) 2010 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry

AB Two monoclonal antibodies (mABs) raised against plum pox virus (PPV)
   were shown to recognize its D, M, and C strains. Conjugates of the
   antibodies with colloidal gold (CG) nanoparticles averaging 26 nm in
   diameter were synthesized. The binding constants of PPV with both the
   native and conjugated mABs were determined using a Biacore X device.
   The complexes between the CG-mAB conjugates and plum pox virions were
   examined by means of transmission electron and atomic force microscopy.
   Using the conjugates with optimal component ratio, an express
   immunochromatographic assay of PPV was developed with a detection limit
   of 3 ng/ml and duration of 10 min. The assay was tested for PPV
   detection in sam- ples of stone fruit tree leaves and demonstrated a
   good compatibility with the data obtained by "sandwich"-ELISA. The
   developed assay can be used in the field and applied for monitoring
   viral infection and for quarantine purposes.

TI Self-Trapped Excitons in Ionic-Covalent Silver Halide Crystals and
   Nanostructures: High-Frequency EPR, ESE, ENDOR and ODMR Studies

AB Silver halides have unique features in solid state physics because
   their properties are considered to be of borderline nature between
   ionic and covalent bonding. In AgCl, the self-trapped hole (STH) is
   centered and partly trapped in the cationic sublattice, forming an Ag2+
   ion inside of a (AgCl6)(4-) complex as a result of the Jahn-Teller
   distortion. The STH in AgCl can capture an electron from the conduction
   band forming the self-trapped exciton (STE). Recent results of a study
   of STE by means of high-frequency electron paramagnetic resonance,
   electron spin echo, electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) and
   optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) are reviewed. The
   properties of the STE in AgCl crystals, such as exchange coupling, the
   ordering of the triplet and singlet sublevels, the dynamical properties
   of the singlet and triplet states, and the hyperfine interaction with
   the Ag and Cl (Br) nuclei are discussed. Direct information about the
   spatial distribution of the wave function of STE unpaired electrons was
   obtained by ENDOR. From a comparison with the results of an ENDOR study
   of the shallow electron center and STH, it is concluded that the
   electron is mainly contained in a hydrogen-like 1s orbital with a Bohr
   radius of 15.1 +/- A 0.6 , but near its center the electron density
   reflects the charge distribution of the hole. The hole of the STE is
   virtually identical to an isolated STH center. For AgCl nanocrystals
   embedded into the KCl crystalline matrix, the anisotropy of the
   g-factor of STE and STH was found to be substantially reduced compared
   with that of bulk AgCl crystals, which can be explained by a
   considerable suppression of the Jahn-Teller effect in nanoparticles. A
   study of ODMR in AgBr nanocrystals in KBr revealed spatial confinement
   effects and allowed estimating the nanocrystal size from the shape of
   the ODMR spectra.

AB This article analyzes the current situation in the field of
   construction and production of pandemic influenza vaccines. The main
   task of protecting the population against influenza pandemics requires
   state-of-the-art approaches to the construction of influenza vaccines
   to be based on reassortment and genetic engineering techniques,
   including the analysis of primary structures of influenza viral genes,
   synthesis and cloning of the main viral genes, reverse genetics
   techniques, and banks of plasmids bearing basic viral genes.
   Reassortant technologies are now giving way to new approaches for
   objective reasons. The state-of-the-art technologies provide safety not
   only at the laboratories where vaccine viruses are constructed but also
   make the production process wholly safe. We are using the following
   approaches to the development of industrial production: use of
   nanoparticles and nanoemulsions as functional adjuvants, construction
   of totally-safe strains for live attenuated influenza vaccines with
   deletions of molecular determinants of pathogenicity, application of
   protein and chemical chaperones to provide self-assembly of
   haemagglutinin molecules of the H1N1v-2009 virus, and impregnation of
   whole-virion preparations with nanoparticles to enhance antigenicity.

AB We studied differences between phagocytic responses to nanoparticles
   (NPs) versus microparticles in the pulmonary region by synthesizing
   magnetite of different sizes and instilling suspensions of these
   particles intra-tracheally into rats' lungs. Ten and 50 nm particles
   caused a greater increase in cell counts of the bronchoalveolar lavage
   fluid (BALF) than the instillation of microparticles. The response to
   10 nm particles was weaker than to 50 nm ones, and the smaller NPs were
   more cytotoxic; both were more cytotoxic than the microparticles.
   Phagocytic activity was also studied using optical and atomic force
   microscopy Phagocytes were more "loaded" in the lungs instilled with 10
   nm particles as compared with those instilled with 50 nm particles; NPs
   of both sizes were engulfed more avidly than microparticles. We found
   in a separate comparative experiment that magnetite NPs were more
   cytotoxic than titanium dioxide and quartz suspensions having particle
   size distribution typical of industrial dusts.

AB In the framework of the Landau mean-field theory, the novel
   thermodynamic model was developed to describe the behavior of the
   melting enthalpy and entropy of nano-objects having the characteristic
   size less than 10 nm. It is implied that nano-objects of the critical
   sizes undergo the second-order transition instead of usual melting. For
   the first time it was revealed that the melting enthalpy and entropy of
   nanoparticles, having the characteristic size less than critical one,
   increase with decreasing the characteristic size of nanoparticles. (C)

AB Lanthanum cobaltate (LaCoOx) nanostructured inside the MCM-41
   mesoporous molecular sieve as well as in the bulk LaCoO3 perovskite
   were characterised by SAXS, ESR, UV-vis DRS, EXAFS and XPS techniques.
   The nanosized LaCoOx particles stabilised within the mesopores of
   MCM-41 matrix containing Co atoms in rather low average oxidation
   state, which is not characteristic of bulk LaCoO3 perovskites.
   Meanwhile, the coordination states of Co in both cases are quite
   similar. Also, the concentration of Co(II) cations in cobaltate
   nanoparticles was found to be twice as in bulk LaCoO3 material. The
   supported cobaltate does not form short-range ordered species of LaCoO3
   in the MCM-41 matrix but presents as the highly disordered,
   oxygen-deficient Co oxide nanophase which is probably to be stabilised
   by La ions present.

AB We present the results of experimental studies of hyperelastic and
   relaxation properties of polymer composites with elastomeric matrix
   made of hydrogenated nitrile butadiene rubber filled with nanoparticles
   of technical carbon in the temperature range 19-150 degrees C. We
   present typical experimental diagrams of deformation of the material
   with constant strain rate and the stress relaxation curves at different
   strain levels under tension and compression conditions. We consider a
   possible version of constitutive relations for describing some
   singularities of the behavior of the material under study. We developed
   a method for determining all the parameters of the accepted relations
   on the basis of the results of uniaxial tests. We found a nonmonotone
   dependence of the relaxation modulus on the temperature and proposed a
   formula for describing this dependence in the temperature range under
   study. To justify the possible use of the considered constitutive
   relations to perform calculations under conditions of arbitrary
   compound stress state, we performed numerical modeling of the
   compression experiment for cylindrical samples. A rather satisfactory
   agreement between the computational results and experimental data was
   obtained.

   water suspension were injected intraperitoneally in a single dose to
   male F-1 (CBAxC57B1/6) mice or to outbred albino rats on days 1, 7, and
   14 of gestation. Silicon crystal nanoparticles in doses of 5, 25, and
   50 mg/kg exhibited no cytogenetic activity in mouse bone marrow cells
   after 24-h exposure and in doses of 5 and 25 mg/kg after 7 and 14-day
   exposure. A 24-h exposure to silicon nanoparticles in a dose of 5 mg/kg
   significantly increased DNA damage (detected by DNA comet assay) in
   bone marrow cells. In a dose of 50 mg/kg they considerably increased
   DNA damage in bone marrow and brain cells after exposure of the same
   duration. Silicon nanoparticles in doses of 5 and 50 mg/kg caused no
   genotoxic effects in the same cells after 3-h and in a dose of 5 mg/kg
   after 7-day exposure. Silicon crystal nanoparticles in a dose of 50
   mg/kg caused death of 60-80% mice after exposure >24 h. Injected in a
   dose of 50 mg/kg on days 1, 7, and 14 of gestation, silicon crystal
   nanoparticles reduced body weight gain in pregnant rats and newborn
   rats at different stages of the experiment, but had no effect on other
   parameters of physical development of rat progeny and caused no

   additives did not exceed 15%. The nanocomposites obtained were
   investigated by means of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and
   differential scanning calorimetry (DSC); in addition, the parameters of
   the oxygen index (OI) and carbon residue (CR) were measured for them.
   The lowest combustibility was exemplified by the composite material

ID TETRANITRATE
AB The temperature dependence of the probability of the explosion of
   pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) with an admixture of NiC particles
   (0.3 wt %) initiated by laser pulses (1064 nm, 20 ns) was studied over
   the temperature range 295-450 K. At 295-350 K, a weak temperature
   dependence was observed. The determining contribution to explosion
   initiation was made by the absorption of laser radiation by
   nanoparticles. The threshold of explosive decomposition at 295 K
   decreased by similar to 40 times compared with samples free of NiC
   nanoparticles. Over the temperature range 400-450 K, the threshold of
   the explosive decomposition of samples containing NiC nanoparticles
   decreased with the activation energy similar to 0.4 eV. A decrease in
   the threshold of explosive decomposition with a similar to 0.4 eV
   activation energy over the temperature range 340-440 K was also
   observed for laser action on PETN samples not containing NiC. A
   hypothesis was suggested according to which the absorption of a light
   quantum caused the transfer of an electron from the valence band of the

AB A procedure for using spin-label EPR spectroscopy in studies of the
   adsorption of macromolecular systems on magnetic nanoparticles and
   quantitative characterization of adsorption layers was developed. The
   procedure was based on measurements of the intensity of EPR signals of
   stable nitroxide radical labels covalently bound with macromolecules.
   The adsorption of spin-labeled macromolecules on the surface of
   nanoparticles caused broadening of EPR lines as a result of the dipole
   interaction of unpaired radical electrons with the magnetic moment of
   particles, which decreased signal intensity. Multilayer adsorption in
   aqueous media of biological fibrinogen molecules and synthetic polymer
   (polyethyleneimine) on magnetite particles with a mean diameter of 17
   nm was studied. The method was shown to be applicable to the estimation
   of the amount of adsorbed macromolecules in multilayer coatings up to
   similar to 40 nm thick.

   lattice was performed by the Monte Carlo method. Changes in the width
   of the distribution (M (w) /M (n) ) as the size of particles increased
   were extremal in character. Distribution narrowing occurred much more
   slowly than in classic polymerization. An empirical equation relating
   the number of free vacancies of a growing particle and its mean size
   was obtained. The introduction of a stabilizer deactivating free
   vacancies of a growing particle caused the appearance of a critical
   phenomenon. At stabilizer concentrations higher than critical,
   large-sized particles could not form. At stabilizer concentrations
   close to critical, the particle-size distribution was bimodal. This
   resulted in an anomalously larger distribution width.

AB This paper reports the results of the study of hydrothermal precious

   formation conditions, the hydrothermal opals differ from exogenic
   precious opals. They are made up of small globules and do not show any
   structuring of their nanoparticles on the basis of closest packing,
   which is typical of exogenic precious opals. During their formation,
   these opals were subjected to pneumatolytic annealing-they experienced
   the impact of a high-temperature vapor under elevated pressure. The
   influence of the thermal effect led to the formation of two-dimensional
   photonic band gaps in the chaotic opal matrix. These bands are composed
   of sheets whose cells were formed owing to the thermal effects
   according to the principle of "Benard cells." Precisely these
   structured blocks and thin films are responsible for the spectral
   dispersion of light and iridescence.

AB Active control of flow over object surfaces achieved by means of
   mechanical and/or electrical methods has recently been studied.
   However, there has been no report on actively switching the surface
   drag of an object by chemical modification of the object's surface.
   Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPA) was grafted onto the surface of an
   aluminium (Al) substrate via (A) surface-initiated atom transfer
   radical polymerization and (B) radical polymerization with an azo-group
   surface initiator. The grafting density was 0.19 and 0.15 chains
   nm(-2), respectively. The water contact angle of the PNIPA-grafted Al
   surface reversibly changed between 55 and 82 for (A) and between 42
   degrees and 65 degrees for (B) at temperatures of 25 and 40 degrees C,
   which was ascribed to the temperature-responsive,
   hydrophilic-hydrophobic switching of the grafted PNIPA surface. The
   PNIPA grafting was applied on the surface of an ogive-shaped Al model.
   The normalized dropping speed of the model in water increased 1.1 times
   at 42 degrees C in comparison to that at 22 degrees C. Switching of the
   surface drag of PNIPA-grafted Al in water was demonstrated on the basis
   of the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of the grafted Al surface, the
   switching occurring with a change in temperature. (C) 2010 Society of

AB The 3d electron states in Ni3Al single crystals doped with Fe, Co, and
   Nb have been investigated using angular correlation of annihilation
   radiation (ACAR). The ACAR spectra contain information on the momentum
   distribution of valence electrons and strongly bound 3d electrons of
   the intermetallic compound. It has been established that the positrons
   in the Ni3Al crystals predominantly annihilate in the nickel sublattice
   from delocalized states. The doping of the compound by the third
   element leads to a variation in the momentum distribution of Ni 3d
   electrons due to the change in the character of interatomic bonds. An
   analysis of the momentum distribution has demonstrated that the niobium
   atoms increase the covalent component of the chemical bond as compared
   to the binary compound due to the d (Nb)-d (Ni) hybridization. The
   doping with cobalt atoms also enhances the tendency toward the
   formation of the covalent bond. At the same time, iron atoms have a
   weak effect on the electronic structure of the intermetallic compound.

AB The aim of the present work was to assess the influences of the
   parameters of the process of preparing polylactide-based nanosomal
   medicinal formulations of rifampicin (Rif) on nanoparticle size, the
   level of Rif sorption, and the kinetics of Rif release in vitro. The
   most effective Rif sorption in nanoparticles (up to 90%) was obtained
   using polylactides with additional terminal carboxyl groups. An
   increase in the initial Rif concentration in the organic phase from 1
   to 5 mg/ml led to some decrease in the extent of sorption (from 89% to
   76%) though it had no significant effect on the sizes of the resulting
   nanoparticles (190-260 nm). The rate of Rif release could be controlled
   by altering the composition of the polymer matrix of the nanoparticles;
   the presence of additional terminal carboxyl groups in polylactides
   gave slower antibiotic release, resulting from tighter interaction with
   the polymer matrix.

AB The effect of the nature of the acido ligand in the precursor and the
   modifying action of elemental phosphorus on palladium catalysts for
   hydrogenation are reported. The large turnover frequency (TOF) and
   turnover number (TON) values observed for styrene hydrogenation on the
   Pd blacks prepared in situ by PdCl2 reduction with hydrogen in DMF are
   due to the formation of fine-particle catalyst with a base particle
   size of 6-10 nm. This is explained by the high PdCl2 reduction rate and
   by the formation of a palladium cluster stabilizer-dimethylammonium
   chloride-in the reaction system via the catalytic hydrolysis of the
   solvent (DMF). The modifying action of elemental phosphorus on the
   properties of the palladium catalysts depends on the nature of the
   acido ligand in the precursor. In the case of oxygen-containing
   precursors at small P/Pd ratios, elemental phosphorus exerts a
   promoting effect, raising the TON and TOF values by a factor of about
   9. In the case of palladium dichloride as the precursor, white
   phosphorus exerts an inhibiting effect. At the same time, it enhances
   the stability of the catalyst, raising the TON value at P/Pd = 0.3. The
   causes of these distinctions are considered.

   3. Subsequent heating of the intermediate up to 300 A degrees C leads
   to the total loss of NH3. The Au-Cl and Au-Au bonds form the local
   environment of Au at the stage of decomposition while only four
   chlorine atoms are around Pd. At the temperature of 330 A degrees C the

AB We study the optical properties of spatially ordered nanocomposites
   consisting of spherical nanoparticles. Based on the integral equation
   method, we derive and investigate the expressions for the fields inside
   and outside the system. We show that two different states of the system
   possibly depend on the material and geometric parameters of the
   nanoaggregate. The states differ by the presence or absence of the
   forbidden band (an interference reflection peak) in the visible range
   for photons of definite energy. In the case of dielectric
   nanoparticles, we show that, if the nanoaggregate is not a photonic
   crystal in the visible wavelength range, scattering of light by the
   particles is suppressed in the nanostructure with definite parameters,
   and the ensemble under study becomes completely transparent. We propose
   a composite material, which possesses a 100% transmission at some
   wavelengths and is formed by densely packed dielectric nanospheres. We
   study the light transmission through an aggregate consisting of metal
   (gold) nanoclusters and find that, in spite of the fact that absorption
   is an intrinsic characteristic of metals, in a definite region of the
   near-IR range of the spectrum, this system is also characterized by an
   anomalously high transmission of radiation (close to 100%).

AB The goal of this study is the development of a method of local laser
   hyperthermia with gold nanoparticles under noninvasive optical
   monitoring of nanoparticle accumulation in tumor tissue in vivo.
   Bifunctional plasmon resonant nanoparticles that are optimal for OCT
   diagnostics and laser heating at the wavelength of 810 nm were used in
   the study. The OCT examination showed that the accumulation of gold
   nanoparticles in the tumor invading into skin was maximal 4-5 h after
   intravenous injection. It was demonstrated that nanoparticle
   accumulation in tumor allowed more local heating and enhanced thermal
   sensitivity of tumor tissue. Laser hyperthermia that heated tumor up to
   44-45 degrees C at maximum nanoparticle accumulation induced apoptotic
   death of tumor cells and inhibited tumor growth by 104% on the 5th day
   after treatment.

   and X-ray microanalysis results show that ternary GICs form only when
   the interlayer spaces in the parent binary GIC are incompletely
   occupied (stage III or lower). The coexistence of different chloride
   molecules in the ternary GIC leads to the formation of intermetallic
   nanoparticles when the material is reduced. The yield of the
   intermetallic phase increases with decreasing graphite particle size.

AB The physical properties of nanocomposite materials which contain

   polymeric dielectric matrix are currently being studied. These
   materials show a low acoustic impedance, resulting in their use as
   low-perturbing substrates for thin piezoelectric plates, as well as
   matching and damping layers for bulk acoustic wave devices. Mechanical
   properties of the materials which contain various Fe and Fe2O3
   nanoparticle concentrations are experimentally defined in the paper. It
   has been shown that the acoustic impedance of the materials under study
   may be varied by more than 30% and 40% for longitudinal and shear
   acoustic waves, respectively, within the same technological procedure.
   The velocities of bulk longitudinal and shear acoustic waves can be
   purposefully changed by more than 40% and 29%, respectively.

AB Various inorganic salts can be encapsulated inside the comparatively
   narrow (0.8-2 nm) hollow core of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs)
   by molten phase capillary wetting. A new synthetic strategy is
   presented allowing the formation of one dimensional (1D) inorganic
   crystals or core-shell nanotubular structures by using multiwall WS2
   nanotubes as host templates. Molten phase wetting with CsI results in
   the formation of 1D crystal structures inside WS2 nanocapillaries with
   a Moire pattern. The relatively large diameter of the WS2 nanotube
   (with inner and outer diameters of ca. 10 and 20 nm, respectively),
   allows a conformal folding of the guest PbI2 layers (PbI2@WS2
   core-shell nanotubes) on the interior wall of the WS2
   nanotube-template, thus leading to relatively defect-free core-shell
   inorganic nanotubular structures, which have not been previously
   observed within carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Core-shell WS2@MoS2 nanotubes
   can be obtained by the gas-phase reaction of MoCl5 with sulfur in the
   presence of WS2 nanotubes. The mechanism of imbibition/solidification
   of the molten salt into the hollow cores of MoS2 nanotubes has been
   studied by molecular dynamics simulations, showing major differences
   between layered compounds and those with quasi-isotropic structure.
   Theoretical considerations also show the conditions for the stability
   of such core-shell 1D nanostructures. These new strategies can open up
   many possibilities for the synthesis of new nanotubular structures.

ID FIBRINOGEN
AB Spin label EPR spectroscopy and dynamic and Rayleigh light scattering
   are employed to study the interaction between magnetite nanoparticles
   with a diameter of 17 nm and plasma proteins (fibrinogen and albumin).
   Protein molecules are shown to be adsorbed on nanoparticle surface with
   the formation of multilayer shells. When a buffer solution (pH 8.5)
   contains 0.01 vol % nanoparticles, 90-100 fibrinogen molecules are
   adsorbed per one particle and the thickness of an adsorbed layer is
   30-40 nm. For albumin, the layer thickness is 10-15 nm. In a constant
   magnetic field, large linear microsized aggregates oriented parallel to
   field lines are formed in dispersions of nanoparticles covered with
   adsorbed protein molecules. The study of fibrin gel formation resulting
   from the action of thrombin enzyme on fibrinogen suggests that, in the
   presence of nanoparticles, the rate of gelation decreases by a factor

   properties of disordered metallodielectric nanocomposites. Expressions
   for the effective fields and effective parameters of nanoparticles with
   allowance for the electrodynamic interaction of nanoparticles have been
   obtained. It has been shown that the polarizing mutual influence of the
   structure elements of a system can give rise to regions with negative
   effective refractive index in the spectrum of individual particles. A
   model of a << left-handed >> medium based on a field manipulation of
   the polarizability of nanoclusters different from the previously

   amorphization, nanostructural parameters, impurity segregation,
   blistering and swelling, electrical and optical properties, hardness,
   strength, plasticity, fracture toughness, and other characteristics
   have been considered. Attention is given to the fact that the
   consolidated (bulk) nanomaterials and isolated nanoparticles behave
   differently under irradiation. The results of theoretical studies and
   simulation (by the moleculardynamics method) of the effect of
   irradiation on the properties of nanomaterials are analyzed.

AB We have predicted and observed for the first time a new phenomenon of
   quasi-specular reflection of cold neutrons at small incidence angles
   from nano-dispersed media. this is due to multiple small-angle
   scattering of neutrons from nano-sized inhomogeneities in the
   scattering potential. The reflection angle as well as the half-width of
   angular distribution of diffusively reflected neutrons is approximately
   equal to the incidence angle. For the powder of diamond nanoparticles
   used, the reflection probability was equal to similar to 30% within the
   detector angular size, which corresponds to 40-50% of total probability
   (albedo) of quasi-specular reflection. The tangential velocity
   component of incident neutrons was up to an order of magnitude larger
   than the critical velocity for pure diamond. We provide an example of
   potential application of the discovered phenomenon for increasing cold
   neutron fluxes available for experiments. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Germanium dioxide (GeO2) crystals were prepared by a chemical
   precipitation method at a relatively low-temperature (100 degrees C).
   The grown crystals were characterized by studying their microstructure,
   optical properties and thermal stability. The results indicate that the
   grown GeO2 crystals exhibit a-quartz type crystal structure. The
   lattice parameters obtained from XRD were a = 4.987(4)angstrom and c =
   5.652(5)angstrom. Electron microscopy analysis indicates a high
   structural quality of GeO2 crystals grown using the present approach.
   Optical absorption measurements indicate a direct bandgap of 5.72 eV
   without any additional bands arising from localized or defect states.
   Thermogravimetric measurements indicate the temperature stability of
   the grown GeO2 nanocrystals. Microscopic analysis coupled with energy
   dispersive X-ray spectroscopy of the GeO2 crystals with alpha-quartz
   type crystal structure indicates their stability in chemical
   composition up to a temperature of 400 degrees C. The surface
   morphology of GeO2 crystals. however, found to be changing with the
   increase in temperature. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   first demonstration of ATO coating from an organic ligand-free
   solution. Uniform coating of different clays and other irregular
   configurations by monosized 5 nm ATO particles was demonstrated. The

   coating over homogeneous agglomeration of the tin oxide particles are
   explained by a hydrogen peroxide capping mechanism and hydrogen bonding

   binary cathodic PtM/C (M = Co, Ni, Cr) catalysts, which were prepared
   by high-temperature synthesis, on their structure, surface segregation,
   and characteristic properties (activity and stability) is studied. It
   is shown that, in the course of treatment in 0.5 M H2SO4 at the
   elevated temperature (60A degrees C), the surface of nanoparticles
   becomes enriched in platinum with the formation of core-shell
   structures. The PtCo/C catalyst is the most efficient one. In this
   case, a compromise between the corrosion resistance and
   electrocatalytic activity is reached due to a higher, as compared with
   PtNi/C and PtCr/C, degree of alloy formation and enriching of surface
   in platinum in the course of corrosive attack. Thereby, the properties
   of platinum on the core surface change as a result of a pronounced
   ligand effect of the core. Thus, depending on the nature of transient
   metal, the binary cathodic PtM/C catalysts differ in their activity and
   stability, which depend on the degree of alloy formation and a
   possibility of formation of core-shell structure as a result of surface
   segregation in the course of synthesis and chemical treatment.

AB Interactions between different types of immune cells and
   organically-modified silica nanoparticles were studied. The silica
   particles functionalized with amine groups were prepared by sol-gel
   technique. Sheep immunoglobulin labeled with fluoresceine
   isothiocyanate was immobilized by adsorption onto the nanoparticles.
   The presence of the functional groups was confirmed by infrared
   absorption measurements. The level of immunocompetent cells interacting
   with the silica nanoparticles was estimated as the amount of
   fluorescence-bright cells by flow cytometry method. A low level of
   interaction of the peripheral blood lymphocytes with the silica
   nanoparticles was found. On the contrary, the macrophages are actively
   involved in interaction with the silica nanoparticles. The influence of
   different size of the silica nanoparticles and incubation time on
   viability and functional activity of peripheral blood lymphocytes and
   peritoneal macrophages were investigated. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals,

AB Weakly basic fluorescent dyes are used to visualize organelles within
   live cells due to their affinity to acidic subcellular organelles. In
   particular, they are used to stain the silica deposited in the silica
   deposition vesicles (SDVs) of diatoms during the course of their
   frustule synthesis. This study involved the synthesis of fluorescent
   dyes derived from oligopropylamines, compounds similar to those found
   in diatoms. The dyes were obtained by reacting oligopropylamines with
   4-chloro-7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole. The reaction was realized
   using methylated oligopropylamines with two or three nitrogen atoms and
   yielded two novel fluorescent dyes: NBD-N2 and NBD-N3. The dyes
   appeared to be highly efficient in the in vivo staining of growing
   siliceous frustules of diatoms at concentrations at least 10 times
   lower than those required for staining with HCK-123. NBD-N3 also
   efficiently stained other subcellular vesicles of eukaryotic
   unicellular algae. NBD-N2 stained only growing diatom frustules,
   whereas NBD-N3 also stained various subcellular organelles of different
   eukaryotic unicellular algae. NBD-N2 and NBD-N3 were not removed from
   stained diatom frustules by drastic treatments with H2SO4 and H2O2.
   Fluorescent silica can also be obtained by its chemical precipitation
   in the presence of NBD-N2 and NBD-N3. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB The nonlinear ac response of the magnetization M(t) of a uniaxially
   anisotropic superparamagnetic nanoparticle subjected to both ac and dc
   bias magnetic fields of arbitrary strengths and orientations is
   determined by averaging Gilbert's equation augmented by a random field
   with Gaussian white-noise properties in order to calculate exactly the
   relevant statistical averages. It is shown that the magnetization
   dynamics of the uniaxial particle driven by a strong ac field applied
   at an angle to the easy axis of the particle (so that the axial
   symmetry is broken) alters drastically leading to different nonlinear
   effects due to coupling of the thermally activated magnetization
   reversal mode with the precessional modes of M(t) via the driving ac
   field.

AB It is shown that high-frequency electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)
   and electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy are
   excellent tools for the investigation of the electronic properties of
   semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). The great attractions of these
   techniques are that, in contrast to optical methods, they allow the
   identification of the dopants and provide information about the spatial
   distribution of the electronic wave function. This latter aspect is
   particularly attractive because it allows for a quantitative
   measurement of the effect of confinement on the shape and properties of
   the wave function. In this contribution EPR and ENDOR results are
   presented on doped ZnO QDs. Shallow donors (SDs), related to
   interstitial Li and Na and substitutional Al atoms, have been
   identified in this material by pulsed high-frequency EPR and ENDOR
   spectroscopy. The shallow character of the wave function of the donors
   is evidenced by the multitude of ENDOR transitions of the Zn-67 nuclear
   spins and by the hyperfine interaction of the Li-7, Na-23 and Al-27
   nuclear spins that are much smaller than for atomic lithium, sodium and
   aluminium. The EPR signal of an exchange-coupled pair consisting of a
   shallow donor and a deep Na-related acceptor has been identified in ZnO
   nanocrystals with radii smaller than 1.5 nm. From ENDOR experiments it
   is concluded that the deep Na-related acceptor is located at the
   interface of the ZnO core and the Zn(OH)(2) capping layer, while the
   shallow donor is in the ZnO core. The spatial distribution of the
   electronic wave function of a shallow donor in ZnO semiconductor QDs
   has been determined in the regime of quantum confinement by using the
   nuclear spins as probes. Hyperfine interactions as monitored by ENDOR
   spectroscopy quantitatively reveal the transition from semiconductor to
   molecular properties upon reduction of the size of the nanoparticles.
   In addition, the effect of confinement on the g-factor of SDs in ZnO as
   well as in CdS QDs is observed. Finally, it is shown that an almost
   complete dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) of the Zn-67 nuclear spins
   in the core of ZnO QDs and of the H-1 nuclear spins in the Zn(OH)(2)
   capping layer can be obtained. This DNP is achieved by saturating the
   EPR transition of SDs present in the QDs with resonant high-frequency
   microwaves at low temperatures. This nuclear polarization manifests
   itself as a hole and an antihole in the EPR absorption line of the SD
   in the QDs and a shift of the hole (antihole). The enhancement of the
   nuclear polarization opens the possibility to study semiconductor
   nanostructures with nuclear magnetic resonance techniques.

AB The analysis of the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) line shape of
   ultra-dispersed diamond (UDD) obtained by conversion of trotyl and
   hexogen mixture and purified from other phases and metal compounds is
   carried out. The observed wide line with g = 2.0028 and a line width of
   8.7 G is shown to be formed by superposition of three lines with line
   widths of 15.3, 8.5 and 3 G and with a ratio of integral intensities of
   70:30:1. The procedure of decomposition and subtraction of wide lines
   has revealed the resolved hyperfine structure (HFS) from donor nitrogen
   with parameters A = 40.8 G and B = 29.2 G. Experimentally obtained
   dependence of the line width of the exchange line on the concentration
   of donor nitrogen in synthetic diamonds assumed that variations in line
   widths of the EPR spectrum components are caused by different local
   concentration of donor nitrogen due to distribution of nitrogen
   impurity during crystallization of diamond nanoparticles. EPR spectra
   of UDD after annealing in vacuum and at high pressures in the range of
   diamond phase stability are also discussed. At high-pressure annealing
   above 973 K, the areas with high concentration of defects are
   graphitized and a narrow Dyson-shape line from conductivity electrons
   and a resolved HFS from donor nitrogen can be observed without
   additional treatment of the EPR spectrum.

   synthesized by the interaction between ammonium thiomolybdate and
   tetraalkylammonium halides involving alkyl groups of different nature.
   The methods of UV and IR spectroscopy along with thermogravimetry are
   used to study the properties of the obtained molybdenum compounds.
   Molybdenum trisulfide nanoparticles are produced by the thermolysis of
   bis(tetraalkylammonium)tetrathiomolybdates, and small angle X-ray
   scattering is applied to determine their sizes and size distribution.
   With the use of different types of tribometers, the antifriction and

   describes the polarization effects observed in the experimental

   It was established that a large number of macromolecules (up to 4300)
   is adsorbed on the selenium nanoparticles, leading to the formation of
   nanostructures with super-high molecular mass and an almost spherical
   form. It was shown that the density of the nanostructures, as
   calculated on the basis of the experimental data on the size and
   molecular mass of the nanocomposite, depends substantially on the
   selenium concentrations in the solution. The thermodynamic state of the
   solutions of nanostructures is described.

AB Sols of zero-valence copper are prepared via the chemical reduction of
   Cu(II) ions by hydrazine borane in aqueous solutions of
   high-molecular-mass poly(acrylic acid), which forms stable complexes
   with copper ions at 20A degrees C in a wide pH range. The study of the
   composition of coordination centers, the ligand surrounding of metal
   ions, and the character of distribution of copper ions over
   poly(acrylic acid) coils in a wide range of solution compositions and
   pH values shows that the size of copper nanoparticles in the sols can
   be controlled by varying the ratio between ligand groups (carboxylate
   anions in poly(acrylic acid)) and copper ions in the reaction system
   during the synthesis of sols. This effect can be accomplished either by
   variation in the initial composition of solution or change in pH (the
   degree of ionization of the initial poly(acrylic acid) in the presence
   of copper ions).

AB Exfoliated graphite/coke composites modified by ZrO2 nanoparticles were
   produced using two different techniques and characterized by means of
   X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. In
   the first, low-density exfoliated graphite/coke blocks were dipped
   repeatedly and alternately in ZrO(NO3)(2) and NH4OH solutions and
   subsequently heat treated at 1200 degrees C in nitrogen to deposit thin
   layers of ZrO2 nanoparticles on the free surfaces of the carbon matrix.
   In the second, a mixture of expandable graphite, phenol-formaldehyde
   resin powder, and ZrOC2O4-modified fibrous cellulose in a sealed
   container was submitted to thermal shock at 900 degrees C followed by
   heat treatment at 1200 degrees C in nitrogen to obtain the modified
   composites. The ZrO2 nanoparticles formed in the second technique were
   incorporated into the composites in three length scales;
   6-30nm-isolated nanoparticles and small blobs, 200-1000nm-lengthy
   dendrite-like structures, and thin layer adhering to the surface of the
   1-40 mu m long cellulose carbon fibers.

AB Kinetics of oxygen reduction is studied on PdCoPt/C catalysts with
   different platinum contents in the metal phase. Catalytic systems are
   synthesized by the high-temperature method. According to XRD analysis,
   as the contents of metallic Pd and Co in the catalysts increase, the
   degree of formation of the alloy between them also increase, which
   however is accompanied by a considerable growth of metal phase
   particles. To minimize this adverse effect, a method of sequential
   metal deposition is put forward. This approach makes it possible to
   considerably decrease the catalyst grain size as compared the
   single-step deposition for high metal phase contents in the catalytic
   system. The kinetics of oxygen reduction on the PdCoPt/C catalysts is
   studied on the rotating disk electrode. Under model conditions (0.5 M
   H2SO4, 60A degrees C, O-2), the 20Pd13Co5Pt/C catalyst exhibited the
   highest activity per mass unit (0.5 M H2SO4, 60A degrees C, O-2),
   namely, 9 A/g(Pd + Pt) at 0.9 V.

   vivo, the epidermis-dermis contrast is improved from 0.78 +/- 0.03 to
   0.92 +/- 0.04 by gold nanoshells applied to the skin surface and from
   0.78 +/- 0.03 to 0.86 +/- 0.04 by titania nanoparticles. The contrast
   of glands is enhanced by titania from 0.68 +/- 0.12 to 0.84 +/- 0.07.
   The highest contrast is reached 120-150 min after applying gold
   nanoshells and 160-200 min after applying titania. According to the MC
   simulation results, the contrast of inclusions increases from zero to
   0.85 and 0.65, respectively.

AB Optical and electrical properties of polyelectrolyte/iron oxide
   nanocomposite planar films on silicon substrates were investigated for
   different amount of iron oxide nanoparticles incorporated in the films.
   The nanocomposite assemblies prepared by the layer-by-layer assembly
   technique were characterized by ellipsometry, atomic force microscopy,
   and secondary ion mass-spectrometry. Absorption spectra of the films
   reveal a shift of the optical absorption edge to higher energy when the
   number of deposited layers decreases. Capacitance-voltage and
   current-voltage measurements were applied to study the electrical
   properties of metal-oxide-semiconductor structures prepared by thermal
   evaporation of gold electrodes on nanocomposite films. The
   capacitance-voltage measurements show that the dielectric constant of
   the film increases with the number of deposited layers and the fixed
   charge and the trapped charge densities have a negative sign.

AB Ab initio calculations are used to model small Au (n) nanoclusters and
   Au (m) SH clusters. The results for the Au-6, Au-8, and Au-20 clusters
   demonstrate that the substitution of a SH group for a Au atom gives a
   stable cluster of the same geometry if the Au atom has an acute bond
   angle and a negative effective charge. The example of the Au-10 cluster
   suggests that SH substitution for Au has a stabilizing effect. The
   modeling results are discussed with application to self-organizing
   thiol monolayers on gold clusters.

AB A kinetic study is performed for variations in the transparency of the

   action of a pulsed electric field. The transparency of the
   near-electrode region is found to be noticeably decreased 0.03-0.3 s
   after the electric field is switched-on and to be subsequently restored
   to the initial level. It is shown that the observed effect can be
   explained by the electric field-induced motion of magnetite
   nanoparticles, which are charged in the near-electrode region. The
   mobility of magnetite particles is estimated from the data on the
   characteristic time of variations in the transparency with the field

AB The properties of CdS nanoparticles synthesized in a polyethylene
   matrix and an ortho-xylene solution are compared. It is shown that
   these nanoparticles have different shapes, structures, and degrees of
   imperfection. Due to these differences, unaggregated nanoparticles in
   solution exhibit luminescence in contrast to nanoparticles in
   polyethylene. The stabilization of nanoparticles in polyethylene most
   probably occurs via OH groups, while nanoparticles in solution are
   stabilized due to partial interaction with dissolved sulfur. The
   absorption and luminescence spectra of samples with polyethylene are
   strongly distorted by reabsorption and scattering, while this effect in
   solution is absent due to a small concentration of nanoparticles.

ID TIO2 NANOPARTICLES; RADIATION
AB Based on the developed mathematical model of skin with the addition of
   titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles 62 and 122 nm in diameter, the
   absorbed energy density distribution in the skin depth is obtained for
   the skin irradiated by UV radiation at wavelengths of 310 and 400 nm.
   It is found that high reflective and scattering properties of the
   corneal layer of the skin treated by photoprotective preparations based
   on nanoparticles prevent the penetration of the UV radiation into inner
   skin layers. It is shown that the majority of the radiation energy is
   captured or reflected in a thin surface skin layer containing
   nanoparticles. A decrease in the thermal load on the tissue is observed.

   partial oxidation of methane (POM). The reduction behavior in hydrogen,
   XRD crystal structure, XPS spectra and POM catalytic activity were

AB Results of tribological testing of stable colloidal dispersions of
   detonation nanodiamond (DND) in combination with other lubricant
   additives in mineral oil, greases as well as in polyalphaolefin (PAO)
   oil are reported. The synergistic effect of combining DND with
   polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), copper nanoparticles or a commercial
   additive Vanlube (non-phosphor containing anti-wear additive) is
   reported. Testing of the formulations using ring-on-ring, shaft/bushing
   and four ball test techniques was performed. The test results reveal
   more than 80-90% decrease of friction coefficient, about 50% decrease
   of a diameter of wear spot as well as several times increase of extreme
   pressure failure load for certain formulations. A strong synergistic
   effect when using a combination of DND/PTFE additives was observed by a
   sharp decrease of friction coefficient. It was also demonstrated that
   the use of smaller DND aggregate size (10nm versus 120nm) resulted in
   better lubricating performance of PAO-based oil formulation. (C) 2010

AB Effects of gold nanoparticles on mouse epididymal sperm were studied
   using model system of nuclear chromatin decondensation in vitro. Sperm
   suspensions were incubated in 1% SDS for 30 min at room temperature.
   The following treatment of gametes in the medium containing gold
   nanoparticles (similar to 2.5 nm) at concentrations of 1.0 x 10(15) and
   0.5 x 10(15) nanoparticles/ml and then additional incubation with
   dithiothreitol (DTT), S-S reducing agent, considerably disturbed the
   process of nuclear chromatin decondensation. Based on these
   observations, we postulate that gold nanoparticles possess
   spermatotoxicity. Binding of gold nanoparticles to DNA molecules may
   underlie the changes in the process of nuclear chromatin decondensation.

AB We propose an alternative technique of continuous-wave terahertz
   radiadion generation based on light scattering by a two-dimensional
   flat lattice of nonlinear metallic nanodimers. We show that it may be
   accompanied by plasmon-driven modulation instability of the lattice
   polarization resulting in periodic oscillations of both transmitted and
   reflected light envelopes. We find that the modulation frequency lies
   in the terahertz band and can be tuned within a wide range, from units
   up to several tens of terahertz, by varying of the incident light
   intensity and frequency. We also compare the suggested method with
   traditional one based on optical heterodyne downconversion.

AB A new type of temperature-sensitive polymer systems based on mixtures
   of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride)
   (PDADMAC) in strongly acidic aqueous medium is described. The mixtures
   exhibit reversible separation into two liquid phases upon a decrease in
   temperature. The phase separation is induced by the intermolecular
   binding between PAA and PDADMAC due to ion dipole interactions between
   protonated carboxylic groups of PAA and quaternary nitrogen atoms of
   PDADMAC. Molecular and hydrodynamic characteristics of the interpolymer
   complexes are probed by static and dynamic light scattering.

AB This work is concerned with the study of Au specimens produced by gold
   deposition on nanosized mixed oxides (alumina, ceria, zirconia)
   prepared by the sol-gel method using organometallic precursors.
   According to X-ray absorption near edge structure, extended X-ray
   absorption fine structure, transmission electron microscopy data, and
   ultraviolet-visible and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements,
   mixed Al-Ce-Zr oxides are quite effective for stabilization of
   different gold specimens. The samples pre- treated in hydrogen at 150A
   degrees C are characterized by the presence of gold Au3+ cations
   located on the surface in slightly disordered octahedral oxygen
   coordination. Metallic gold nanoparticles with a size of about 2 nm and
   gold clusters were found in the samples treated in hydrogen at 300A
   degrees C.

AB Direct current magnetron sputtering of a metallic W + Au target or
   high-frequency magnetron sputtering of WO3 + Au oxide targets was used
   to prepare thin (about 100 nm) nanocrystalline WO3 films with the
   addition of gold (disperse layers of catalytic gold were additionally
   deposited on the surface of films). The composition and micromorphology
   of the surface of films and the electrical and gas sensitive
   characteristics of nitrogen dioxide sensors were studied to determine
   the mechanism of the influence of gold on the properties of WO3 films.
   The films were shown to contain the beta-WO3 orthorhombic and
   gamma-WO2.72 monoclinic phases and gold particles. The presence of the
   nonstoichiometric gamma-WO2.72 phase was shown to increase the
   concentration of oxygen vacancies in films and decrease the resistance
   of sensors to 1-2 M Omega. Gold nanoparticles 9-15 nm in size
   segregated on the surface of semiconductor crystallites and increased
   the response of sensors to NO2. The conclusion was drawn that deposited
   catalytic gold layers increased the response to traces of nitrogen
   dioxide.

AB Modern chemical synthesis makes heavy use of different types of
   catalytic systems: homogeneous, heterogeneous and nano-sized. The
   latter - nano-sized catalysts have given rise in the 21st century to a
   rapidly developing area of research encompassing several prospects and
   opportunities for new technologies. Catalytic reactions ensure high
   regio- and stereoselectivity of chemical transformations, as well as
   better yields and milder reaction conditions. In recent years several
   novel catalytic systems were developed for selective formation of
   carbon-heteroatom and carbon-carbon bonds. This review presents the
   achievements of our team in our studies on various types of catalysts
   containing metal nanoparticles: palladium-containing diblock copolymer
   micelles; soluble palladium-containing polymers; metallides on a
   support; polymeric metal salts and oxides; and, in addition, metal-free
   organic catalysts based on soluble polymers acting as nanoreactors.
   Representative examples are given and discussed in light of possible
   applications to solve important problems in modern organic synthesis.

AB Suspensions of microparticles produced in a polymerase chain reaction
   on plasmid templates using different primers have been studied by
   electron microscopy. In all of the samples, microspheres of two types
   have been detected: of a spherical or ellipsoid form (smooth, without
   thorns) and of an ellipsoid form with big thorns and/or outgrowths; the
   diameter of the microspheres varies from 1 to 3 mu m. Along with
   microspheres, so-called three-dimensional network structures of various
   shapes formed by three-dimensional nanoparticles of a particular
   topology have been observed. In some samples, discs a few microns in
   diameter and several dozen nanometers in thickness have been detected.
   It has been shown that the quantity of netshaped structures and discs
   sharply increases during asymmetric PCR. In addition, DNA nanofilaments
   (nanowires), electron-dense point particles (nanodots),
   electron-translucent nanoparticles in the form of rags, and large
   electron-dense spherical nanoparticles have been found. Suspensions of
   microparticles after their quick (5 min) heating at 94A degrees C have
   been examined. The partial melting of smooth microspheres (without
   thorns) has been established: they lose a part of the DNA so that the
   details of their structure (ultrastructure) can be discerned.
   Simultaneously, clusters of nanowires appear after the heating. The
   molecular mechanisms of the formation of nanoand microparticles are
   discussed.

   the foil in two-layer targets (polymer aerogel plus Al foil). We
   observed this effect earlier at the accuracy limit of the experiment.
   Preheating may be explained by the initial transmission of laser
   radiation by an inhomogeneous plasma and aerogel remnants. The fraction
   of laser energy that passed through a microheterogeneous plasma to the
   foil or shell is small in comparison with the total energy in the
   pulse, but it comes to the target (foil or shell) at the initial period
   of the laser pulse and can be significantly affected by the dynamics of
   plasma and the efficiency of spherical cryogenic thermonuclear targets.

   operates in the hole accumulation mode. The FET mobility values in the
   PFO : ZnO films with a high ZnO concentration are close to the mobility
   of polycrystalline ZnO. A significant increase in the EL intensity of

   thick-film carbon-containing electrode modified by bismuth
   nanoparticles is shown to be similar in its analytical parameters to
   the commercially available thick-film carbon-containing electrode
   premodified by calomel, and substantially exceeds carbon-containing
   electrodes with electrolytically deposited bismuth films in its
   properties. The limits of detection for heavy metals by stripping
   voltammetry are as follows (mu g/L): 0.38 for Zn(II), 0.40 for Cd(II),
   and 0.55 for Pb(II) at the preconcentration time 180 s.

DE composite nanoparticles; light absorption and scattering; J-aggregates
AB The results of the theoretical study of optical properties of composite
   nanoparticles consisting of a metal core (Ag, Au, Cu, Al, Ni, Cr) and a
   J-aggregate shell of organic dye are presented. Light extinction,
   absorption, and scattering coefficients in colloidal solutions were
   calculated within the model based on the Mie theory modified taking
   into account dimensional phenomena and complemented by calculations of
   complex dielectric functions of the metal core and J-aggregate shell.
   The model adequately explains the features observed in light absorption
   and scattering spectra by hybrid nanoparticles, associated with the
   plasmon resonance in the metal core and with electronic excitation of
   the J-aggregate. The strong dependence of the results on geometrical
   parameters of nanoparticles and dielectric constants of core and shell
   materials was demonstrated. Methods for controlling the effects of the
   plasmon-exciton interaction in the system and optical properties of
   composite materials developed based on nanoparticles under study are
   discussed.

AB The perspectives of using liposomes for delivery of drugs to desired
   parts of the human body have been intensively investigated for more
   than 30 years. During this time many inventions have been suggested and
   different kinds of liposomal devices developed, and a number of them
   have reached the stages of preclinical or clinical trials. The latest
   techniques can be used to develop biocompatible nano-sized liposomal
   containers having some abilities of artificial intellect, such as the
   presence of sensory and responsive units. However, only a few have been
   clinically approved. Further improvements in this area depend on our
   knowledge of the interactions of drugs with the lipid bilayer of
   liposomes. Further studies on liposomal transport through the human
   body, their targeting of cells requiring therapeutic treatment, and
   finally, the development of techniques for controlled drug delivery to
   desired acceptors on cell surfaces or in cytoplasm are still required.

AB Nano-scale rods and particles having the axes of fivefold symmetry,
   i.e., pentagonal nanorods and nanoparticles, are theoretically and
   experimentally investigated. Such objects possess elastic strains and
   mechanical stresses. In the present research a new mechanism of stress
   relaxation in nanorods and nanoparticles is considered. The mechanism
   is implemented by a formation of a surface layer with crystal lattice
   mismatch. The elastic fields and energies for nanorods and
   nanoparticles with the mismatched layers are calculated in the
   framework of the disclination model. The optimal mismatch parameter
   giving the maximal energy release is determined. The threshold radius
   as the minimal radius of nanorods or nanoparticles for which the
   formation of the layer is energetically favorable, is found. The
   threshold radius is approximately 10 nm for nanoparticle and 100 nm for
   nanorod of typical FCC metal.

AB X-ray powder diffraction, magnetization, transport and magnetic
   resonance measurements of nanosize La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LCMO) manganites
   have been performed. The nanosize manganites were synthesized with a
   co-precipitation method at different (600, 700, 800 and 1000 degrees C)
   temperatures. The crystal structure of the nanopowders obtained was
   determined to be perovskite-like with a rhombohedral distortion (the
   space group R (3) over barc). The average size of synthesized
   nanoparticles (from 17 to 88 nm) was estimated using the X-ray
   diffraction and low temperature adsorption of argon methods. All the
   nanosize manganites show ferromagnetic-like ordering. Both the Curie
   temperature and magnetization decrease with reducing the particle size.
   The decrease of magnetization is due to the disordered surface shell of
   particles. The disordered surface layer is a source of the surface
   anisotropy and is responsible for the increase of coercivity.
   Temperature dependences of the magnetic resonance spectra parameters
   have allowed obtaining information on dynamics of magnetic properties
   in the nanoparticle systems. The resistivity was established to become
   higher by reducing the particles' size and increases to a great extent
   in nanoparticles with the smallest average size at low temperatures.
   Themagneticentropywas shown to be smaller for the small particles.
   Using the temperature dependence of magnetic entropy the relative
   cooling power of the nanosize samples studied was evaluated. (C) 2010

AB The formulas for calculation of the number of atoms and their space
   distribution in nanocrystals and quantum dots with symmetry of diamond,
   lonsdaleite, sphalerite, and wurtzite structures are reported. The
   numbers of atoms are determined by six structurally invariant numbers
   and the symmetry group of order h. The atom densities of such
   structures are established as well as their dependences from quantum
   dots size. Optical properties and the change of the emission wave
   length from sizes of quantum dots with sphalerite and wurtzite
   structures are considered. Because the properties of quantum dots
   depend on their size dispersion formula of quantum dots with diamond
   and lonsdalait structures is proposed.

TI Solid-phase synthesis of L1(0)-FePd(001) epitaxial thin films:

DT Article

AB The solid-phase synthesis of the L1(0)-FePd magnetically hard phase in
   Fe(001)/Pd(001) epitaxial films has been experimentally investigated.
   The formation of three types of L1(0)-FePd ordered crystallites whose c
   axes coincide with the aOE (c) 100 > directions of the MgO(001)
   substrate begins at the Fe/Pd interface at a temperature of 450A
   degrees C. After an increase in the annealing temperature to 500A
   degrees C, structural rearrangement occurs and gives rise to the
   predominant growth of L1(0)-FePd crystallites with the c axis
   perpendicular to the film plane. After 10-h annealing, the fraction of
   such crystallites becomes dominant, leading to large perpendicular
   anisotropy. The first magnetocrystalline-anisotropy constant of the
   L1(0)-FePd phase has been determined and the second constant has been
   estimated. It has been shown that magnetic anisotropy in the
   L1(0)-FePd(001) basal plane cannot be described by the biaxial
   anisotropy of the tetragonal crystal. The annealing above 500A degrees
   C results in the evolution of L1(0)-FePd to a disordered cubic phase.

AB Objective: This pilot open-label clinical study evaluated the safety
   and pharmacokinetics of albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) in
   patients with advanced solid tumors and hepatic dysfunction.
   Research design/methods: Dosing was determined according to baseline
   bilirubin levels as described in the package insert for Taxol (R)
   (paclitaxel), and patients received 130, 200 or 260 mg/m(2)
   nab-paclitaxel every 3 weeks.
   Results: Thirty patients with elevated baseline bilirubin and aspartate
   aminotransferase levels received nab-paclitaxel. The most
   commonly-occurring grade 3/4 adverse events were neutropenia and
   fatigue. Grade 3/4 neutropenia occurred in 10, 30 and 30% of patients
   receiving 130, 200 and 260 mg/m(2) nab-paclitaxel, respectively. Grade
   3 fatigue presented in 50 and 30% patients receiving 130 and 200
   mg/m(2) nab-paclitaxel, respectively (no grade 4 event). Only one (10%)
   patient had a grade 3 sensory neuropathy in the 260 mg/m(2)
   nab-paclitaxel arm. Treatment-related grade 3 bilirubinemia and
   elevated aspartate aminotransferase was observed in patients receiving
   130 mg/m(2) (30 and 10%, respectively) and 260 mg/m(2) nab-paclitaxel
   (20 and 10%, respectively). One patient had a grade 4 bilirubinemia in
   the 200 mg/m(2) nab-paclitaxel arm. Total bilirubin levels were
   inversely correlated to paclitaxel clearance (p < 0001).
   Conclusions: nab-Paclitaxel has an acceptable tolerability profile in
   patients with solid tumors and hepatic dysfunction. The safety and
   pharmacokinetic results support the same dose modification scheme
   recommended for cremophor-based paclitaxel.

   structures
ID 2ND-ORDER NONLINEARITY; WAVE-GUIDES; SILICA
AB A new technique to imprint phase and amplitude patterns into glass is
   proposed. The technique is based on the thermal poling of oxide glasses
   via a figurate plane anode which has a relief with a given 2D
   modulation of the pattern depth. Poling with such an anode results in
   the subsurface layer depleted of high-mobility ions and characterized
   by 2D modulation of its thickness directly determined by the relief of
   the anode pattern. Due to the 0.02 difference in refractive indices of
   the depleted layer and bulk glass, glasses poled via the figurate anode
   operate like optical phase structures, e.g. diffraction phase gratings
   in the case of a regular pattern. It is found that phase contrast in
   such structures (for the glasses used in this work) increases linearly
   with the total charge passing through the glass sample in the process
   of poling, with the maximal achieved phase contract of 1.32 pi. If
   initial glass contains silver ions, the bottom of the depleted layer
   can be treated as a latent relief image of the anode relief pattern,
   which can be visualized by heat treatment in H-2 atmospheres due to the
   formation of silver nanoparticles absorbing visible light.
   Physico-chemical processes involved in the structure formation are
   discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB AgCl and AgBr nanoparticles formation conditions were studied by a
   thermochemical method in AOT (sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate)
   inverted micellar systems, in AOT-dioctyl sulfide (DOS) mixed micelles,
   and (for comparison) in aqueous solutions. The heats of formation of
   AgCl and AgBr nanoparticles in AOT micelles in exchange reactions with
   potassium halides are, respectively, -55.5 x (1 +/- 0.07) and -68.6 x
   (1 +/- 0.07) kJ/mol, that is, smaller in magnitude than the values
   obtained for aqueous solutions (-68 x (1 +/- 0.07) and -88 x (1 +/-
   0.07) kJ/mol). This difference arises from the existence of particle
   interactions causing the formation of coagulation contacts between
   halide particles followed by precipitation in an aqueous phase and the
   absence of such interactions in a micellar medium. DOS interacts with
   AOT (to form mixed micelles) and with silver ions (in long-term
   contact), thus reducing the heats of reactions.

AB Periodic structures of spherical silicon particles are analyzed using
   the coupled-dipole equations for studying optical response features and
   local electromagnetic fields. The model takes into account the electric
   and magnetic dipole moments of the particles embedded in a homogeneous
   dielectric medium. Particles with radius of 65 nm and larger are
   considered. It is shown that, due to the large permittivity of silicon,
   the first two Mie resonances are located in the region of visible
   light, where the absorption is small and the extinction is basically
   determined by scattering. The main contribution is given by the induced
   magnetic and electric dipoles of the particles. Thus, in contrast to
   metal particle arrays, here is a possibility to combine separately
   either the electric or magnetic dipole resonances of individual
   particles with the structural features. As a result, extinction spectra
   can have additional narrow resonant peaks connected with multiple light
   scattering by the magnetic dipoles and displaying a Fano-type resonant
   profile. Reflection and transmission properties of the Si particle
   arrays are investigated and the conditions of low light reflection and
   transmission by the particle arrays are discussed, as well as the
   applicability of the dipole approach. It is shown that the light
   transmission of finite-size arrays of Si particles can be significantly
   suppressed at the conditions of the particle magnetic dipole resonance.
   It is demonstrated that, using resonant conditions, one can separately
   control the enhancements of local electric and magnetic fields in the
   structures.

AB Silver nanoparticles were synthesised in thin surface layers of SiO2
   glass by 30 key implantation of Ag+ ions with various fluences.
   Properties of the composites were studied using optical spectroscopy
   and atomic force microscopy. Optical spectra reveal specific absorption
   bands assigned to the surface plasmon resonance of the nucleated Ag
   nanoparticles. The spectral positions of absorption maxima are found to
   be dependent on the ion fluence that corresponds to the difference in
   mean sizes of the nanoparticles. Microscopy study shows formation of
   hemispherical nanosize bumps on the glass surfaces which represent a
   near-surface fraction of the partly towered nanoparticles.
   Post-implantation annealing leads to a shift of the plasmon maxima and
   to a change of the band widths. The transformations of optical spectra
   are in good agreement with the change of nanoparticle sizes found by
   atomic force microscopy. Possible mechanisms governing the
   redistribution of the nanoparticles in size under the thermal treatment
   are suggested and discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents the wear analysis of sliding friction pair
   "Ball-on-Disk" lubricated with pure mineral oil and the same oil
   modified with zinc nanoparticles. Friction pair elements, produced from
   different hardness structural steel of 0.8% carbon content, abraded
   differently when operated with non-modified and modified oil. When
   lubricating with modified oil, the width of wear path of friction pairs
   with tempered steel disk (63 HRC) increased by 20.5% comparing to
   non-modified lubricant; whereas using the thermally non-treated disk
   (185 HB) the oil with zinc nanoparticles reduces the wear path by 10%.
   Lubricating effect of oil with zinc nanoparticles can be explained by
   the interaction of zinc nanoparticles and the oxygene in oil and also
   by the interaction of mechanical particles and friction surfaces.

ID DETONATION; AMPLIFICATION; TOMOGRAPHY
AB Synchrotron radiation (SR) offers a unique chance to study the
   structure of a substance in fast processes. Since SR is emitted by
   electron bunches in a storage ring, the SR burst corresponding to a
   single bunch may be very short. Should a detector capable of detecting
   SR from a single bunch without mixing signals from different bunches be
   available, it is possible to obtain information on changes in the state
   of the material in a sample under investigation with a very high time
   resolution. A detector for imaging of explosions on an SR
   beam-DIMEX-has been developed by the Budker Institute of Nuclear
   Physics (Siberian Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences,
   Novosibirsk). This detector is a high-pressure ion-ization chamber with
   a strip readout at a pitch of 0.1 mm. The electron component of primary
   ionization is collected within 50 ns, which is substantially shorter
   than the orbital period of a bunch in the VEPP-3 storage ring (250 ns).
   The DIMEX is filled with a Xe-CO2 mixture (3: 1) at an absolute
   pressure of 7 atm. The spatial resolution of the detector is similar to
   210 A mu m, and its efficiency for radiation with an energy of 20 keV
   is a parts per thousand yen50%. The dynamic range of the detector is
   similar to 100, which allows one to measure the signal with an accuracy
   of similar to 1%. In this case, the maximum flux of X-ray photons, at
   which the DIMEX operates in a linear region, is similar to 10(10)
   photons/(channel s). Today, the detector has been used in experiments
   aimed at studying evolution of the density in detonation waves and
   processes of nanoparticle production at the VEPP-3 storage ring by
   employing the small-angle X-ray scattering technique.

   of two types of silica (silica gel and layer silica) modified by
   gamma-ferric oxide nanoparticles of a different size (2-4 and 8-10 nm)
   were studied in the benzene alkylation by benzyl chloride. The
   catalysts were characterized by means of Mossbauer spectroscopy,
   temperature programmed NH3 desorption and diffuse reflectance infrared
   Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFT) using CO and CD3CN as test
   molecules. It was found that the particle size and the silica structure

ID FIELD
AB The spatial distribution of the electronic wave function of a shallow
   donor (SD) in a ZnO semiconductor quantum dots (QD's) has been
   determined in the regime of quantum confinement by using the nuclear
   spins as probes. Hyperfine (HF) interactions as monitored by electron
   nuclear double resonance spectroscopy quantitatively reveal the
   transition from semiconductor to molecular properties upon reduction of
   the size of the nanoparticles. Influence of confinement effect on
   g-factor value of SD's in ZnO and CdS QD's was displayed. The almost
   complete dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) of nuclear spins has been
   demonstrated can be achieved in ZnO QD's by saturating the EPR
   transition of the SD present in the QD's with using high-frequency at
   low temperatures. Polarization of Zn-67 nuclear spins in ZnO core and
   of H-1 nuclear spins in the Zn(OH)(2) capping layer have been obtained
   which manifests itself via the creation of a hole and an antihole in
   the EPR absorption line of the SD in QD's and a shift of the hole
   (antihole). The enhancement of the nuclear polarization opens the
   possibility to study semiconductor nanostructures with NMR techniques

AB Novel amphiphilic poly-N-vinylpyrrolidone derivatives with different
   molecular weight of hydrophilic PVP fragment and one secondary
   di-n-alkyl terminal hydrophobic fragment of different length were
   synthesized to compare their inclination for formation of nano-scaled
   micelle-like aggregates in aqueous media with previously studied
   primary n-alkyl terminated poly-N-vinylpyrrolidones. The behavior of
   amphiphilies in water solutions was studied and critical aggregation
   concentration values for prepared polymer samples were determined by
   fluorescence spectroscopy and compared with those for primary n-alkyl
   derivatives. Polymeric micelle-like particles with or without
   encapsulated drug were prepared using dialysis or solvent evaporation
   techniques. Indomethacin was incorporated into hydrophobic inner core
   of these nanoparticles as a typical model drug. Dynamic
   light-scattering studies determined that the average size of particles
   formed was from 90 nm up to 600 nm with monodisperse size distribution
   and the nanoparticle size slightly increased with the amount of
   indomethacin encapsulated into inner core of the particles. In vitro
   release experiments carried out at different medium pH values using
   indomethacin-loaded nanoparticles exhibited slow and steady drug
   release into the medium.

AB Metal-nanoparticle composites were fabricated by implantation of 60 keV
   Cu-, Ag-, and Au- ions into LiNbO3 single crystals. Monitoring of the
   chemical composition variations using ion-induced photon emission
   (IIPE) has shown that the ion implantation stimulates the accumulation
   of weakly bounded atoms at the irradiated surface. The contribution of
   weakly bounded atoms to IIPE was observed by stopping and subsequent
   renewal of ion implantation. The irradiated surface of nanocomposites
   experienced lasting rearrangement after ion implantation resulted in
   formation of surface structures. Results suggest that the heavy-ion
   implantation can be used for embedment of metal nanoparticles and
   initiation of self-organization on surfaces.

AB The behavior of minima and the saddle point of the work of the droplet
   formation on soluble condensation nucleus as a function of the chemical
   potential of undersaturated (over the plane surface of pure solvent)
   solvent vapor is studied. Activation barriers for the direct transition
   of droplet from the state with partially dissolved nucleus to the state
   with completely dissolved nucleus and for the reverse transition of the
   crystallization of nucleus in the droplet are numerically determined
   within the wide range of the chemical potentials of undersaturated
   vapor. It is shown that the activation barrier for the direct
   transition increases rapidly, whereas the activation barrier for
   reverse transition lowers (although remaining finite) with a decrease
   in the chemical potential of vapor below its threshold value for the
   barrierless transition to the state with completely dissolved nucleus.
   As a result, droplets with completely or partially dissolved nucleus
   actually do not coexist in the atmosphere of undersaturated vapor. It
   is demonstrated that, upon variations in the relative humidity of
   undersaturated vapor, the change in thermodynamically stable and
   unstable description variables of the states of near-critical droplet
   takes place and ph ysical meaning of these variables is explained.

AB Microstructural evolution of cold-worked fcc Fe-Ni-Ti(Al) aging alloys
   subjected to isochronal annealing has been investigated using positron
   annihilation. The stages corresponding to vacancy defect annealing,
   heterogeneous nucleation of gamma'-phase particles and
   recrystallization have been clearly identified. It has been found that,
   due to strong interaction of vacancies with titanium atoms in the
   Fe-Ni-Ti alloy, low-temperature (450-700 K) segregation of titanium and
   formation of Ni3Ti particles at dislocations are observed. The Ni3Ti
   particles strongly pin the dislocations, leading to recrystallization
   retardation. At the same time, particles block positron trapping at
   dislocations. Decomposition of cold-worked Fe-Ni-Al alloy takes place
   over the same temperature range (800-900 K) as in the solution annealed
   state of this alloy. Precipitation of the Ni3Al and high-temperature
   bcc-phase particles also leads to dislocation pinning and inhibiting
   recovery of the microstructure in cold-worked Fe-Ni-Al alloy. (C) 2010

ID PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY
AB This paper deals with the possibility of application of aluminum
   phthalocyanine (AlPc) nanoparticles in clinical practice. AlPc
   fluoresces in the molecular form but in the form of nanoparticles it
   does not. Separation of molecules from an AlPc nanoparticle and
   therefore the appearance of fluorescence occurs under the effect of a
   number of biochemo-physical factors. Owing to this feature the
   application of AlPc nanoparticles followed by the measurement of
   fluorescence spectra is proposed as a diagnostics method. It was shown
   that after AlPc nanoparticle application on a tooth surface the
   fluorescence intensity in the enamel microdamage area is 2-3 times
   higher than that in the normal enamel area. The appearance of
   fluorescence after application of AlPc nanoparticles on skin autografts
   testifies to the presence of inflammation.

   of Y2O3-Yb nanoparticles elaborated by the polyol mediated synthesis
   method have been measured at liquid helium temperature under VUV

   Transfer Luminescence (CTL) and exciton excitation peaks differs from
   that for Y2O3-Yb single crystal, and changes with the particle size
   variation from 13 to 52 nm. This effect can be connected with the
   variation of excitation light scattering with particle dimensions. Two
   types of luminescence decay acceleration are observed. Acceleration of
   exponential decay time with decrease of nanoparticle size and the
   appearance of very fast decay component in small nanoparticles that we
   connected to energy transfer to the surface defects.

AB Two new methods of preparation of nanocrystalline scintillators are
   described. Laser ablation of microscopic powders immersed in optically
   transparent liquid was used to produce spherical nanoparticles, which
   preserved the initial compositions. Electric arc discharge between
   electrodes of definite metals immersed in water solutions of different
   salts produces a vast variety of scintillating compounds with
   nanoscopic dimensions and morphologies having crystallographic symmetry
   of the corresponding equilibrium phases. A wide range of different
   compositions and structures of tungsten oxides are obtained during one
   synthesis process, which is due to variety of temperatures and other
   conditions around the arc channel. It was found that the light emission
   spectroscopy of the discharge is a rather informative method of
   diagnostics of the process of the nanoparticle synthesis inside the
   discharge chamber. The synthesis of nanoscintillators by arc discharge
   turned out to be rather efficient and capable to create nanocrystalline
   scintillators of easily regulated compositions. Hydrogen injection into
   nanoparticles of tungsten oxide is detected by light emission and
   infrared absorption spectroscopy. Hydrogenated nanoscintillators
   obtained by this method are interesting for registration of fast
   neutrons.

AB Studies of complex permittivity and third harmonic generation were
   carried out for a Rochelle salt loaded porous alumina film within a
   temperature range from 80 to 325K in comparison with studies of
   Rochelle salt single crystals. Only one peak of real part of
   permittivity correspondingto the lower (re-entrant) phase transition in
   confined Rochelle salt was observed which temperature was reduced by 10
   K comparedto the relevant temperature in bulk. The upper phase
   transition was shifted beyond the decomposition temperature in
   agreement with previous findings. The amplitude of the third harmonic
   which correlates to the emergence of ferroelectricity was found to
   beenhanced above 245 K till 325 K. The results obtained evidence the
   strong extensionofthe ferroelectric phase in confined Rochelle salt due
   to the decrease and the increase of the lower and upper phase
   transition temperatures, respectively. The physical nature of such
   extension is discussed.

AB A comparative study of chemical and enzymatic methods of aniline
   polymerization was carried out. Fungal laccase from Trametes hirsuta
   was used in the synthesis of polyaniline nanoparticles made with
   poly(2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid) (PAMPS). Template
   polymerization of aniline was carried out in aqueous buffer. It was
   shown that the laccase had high long-term and operating stabilities
   under acidic condition favorable for synthesis of conducting
   polyaniline. UV-vis, FTIR spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry analysis
   are used for the characterization of the polyelectrolyte complexes of
   polyaniline and PAMPS. The incorporation of the polymeric acid in
   polyaniline has been demonstrated by atomic force microscopy. The size
   and morphology of the nanoparticles of the polyaniline PAMPS complexes
   depended on the method of the synthesis. A comparison of some physical
   and chemical properties of water dispersible conducting
   polyaniline-PAMPS was performed under production by enzymatic and
   chemical methods. It was found a difference in structures and some
   physicochemical properties of polyaniline colloids prepared by chemical
   and laccase-catalyzed methods. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl

AB The structures consisting of silver nanoparticles and polyacrylonitrile
   (PAN) are synthesized by the photopolymerization method yielding a
   homogeneous dispersion and a small size spread of nanoinclusions in PAN
   matrices, which is observed in images of transmission electron
   microscopy. The optical properties of the nanocomposites are studied to
   depend upon conditions of their obtaining. The minimum in the
   transmission spectra in a wavelength region of 430 nm, which is
   attributed to the surface plasmon resonance of silver nanoparticles, is
   found. The absorption peaks in the infrared range are observed at
   similar to 820 and similar to 1110 cm(-1) for the silver nitrate
   (AgNO3) and the photoinitiator, respectively.

AB The calculations of interaction of Co-6 and Pt-6 nanoparticles with
   silicalite ZSM-5 and zeolite HZSM-5 were performed by the density
   functional theory method. Introduction of cobalt or platinum to
   silicalite slightly stabilizes the metal cluster and induces a small
   positive charge on the Co-6 particle and an appreciable negative charge
   on the Pt-6 particle. In the case of cobalt, the interaction of the
   metal particle with the acid zeolite is accompanied by a proton
   transfer from the Bronsted acid site to the surface of the metal
   cluster, resulting in the formation of a hydride-like structure,
   whereas in the Pt-zeolite system a complex cation containing adsorbed
   hydrogen atom is formed.

AB The influence of the shape and size of nanocrystals on the lattice
   relaxation of body-centered cubic metals (zirconium, iron) at a
   constant temperature has been investigated using the molecular dynamics
   method with the many-body interatomic interaction potential obtained in
   terms of the embedded-atom model. The calculations have been performed
   for isolated clusters with sizes ranging from 2.5 to 17 nm for
   zirconium and from 2 to 14 nm for iron. It has been demonstrated that,
   in free zirconium and iron particles, the relaxation of the lattice
   constant along the [100], [010], and [001] directions has an
   oscillatory character. Irrespective of the size of the zirconium and
   iron particles, the equilibrium distances between atoms at the center
   of cubic clusters are minimum compared to those observed in
   near-surface layers and the equilibrium value of the lattice parameter
   for the bulk sample. In spherical clusters, the region of a maximum
   contraction corresponds to a depth approximately equal to 0.2 particle
   diameter from the surface. An increase in the size of both cubic and
   spherical clusters leads to a decrease in the deviation of the local
   lattice parameter from the equilibrium value for the bulk sample. It
   has been established that the size and shape of the cluster
   substantially affect the temperature and mechanism of the structural
   transformation from the body-centered cubic phase into the hexagonal
   close-packed phase.

AB The modification of the shape of ion-synthesized silver and copper
   nanoparticles in a silica glass during laser annealing has been studied
   for the first time by Raman spectroscopy at a temperature of 77 K. The
   laser annealing has been carried out for a wavelength of 694 nm at the
   edge of the plasmon absorption spectrum of nanoparticles. A comparison
   of the experimental spectra and the calculated modes of in-phase
   bending vibrations of the "harmonica" type in nanostrings of the
   corresponding metals has demonstrated their good agreement. The effects
   observed have been discussed from the standpoint of the size
   quantization of vibrations in metal nanowires. This methodical approach
   has made it possible to estimate the sizes of the Ag and Cu
   nanoparticles under the assumption that they have an elongated form; in
   this case, their average lengths are equal to 2.5 and 1.4 nm,
   respectively.

AB A new method of sol-gel polymer template synthesis of mesoporous

   ratios from 0.006 to 0.009. The catalytic film thickness was varied
   from 300 to 1000 nm while providing a uniform catalyst distribution
   with a desired catalyst loading (1 wt. % Au nanoparticles) throughout
   the film. The films were characterized by TEM, SEM, ethanol adsorption
   and contact angle measurements. The calcination of the as-synthesized
   films at 573 K reduced Ti4+ sites to Ti3+. A 300 nm thick Au-containing
   film showed an initial TOF of 1.4 s(-1) and a selectivity towards
   unsaturated alcohols as high as 90% in the hydrogenation of citral.
   Thicker films demonstrated a high selectivity towards the saturated
   aldehyde (above 55%) and a lower intrinsic catalytic activity (initial
   TOF of 0.7-0.9 s(-1)) in the absence of internal diffusion limitations.

AB Very cold neutrons (VCN) scattering method was used to study the
   morphology of polyolefine based nanocomposites. The nanocomposites were
   prepared by the melt mixing method. The special surface active
   additions and the fillers surface modification were used to improve the
   polymer-filler compatibility. The multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT),
   the calcium carbonate (CC) submicron particles and the layered natural
   mineral montmorillonite (MMT) nanoparticles were used as the fillers.
   The fractal structural model was used to describe the VCN scattering on
   the nanofillers agglomerates. It was shown by VCN scattering that the
   volume part of isolated MWCNTs in polypropylene (PP) based composites
   decreases with the increase of the filler loading, the density of MWCNT
   packing in agglomerates increases with the total volume nanotube
   concentration and decreases with the nanotube surface modification. It
   was revealed that the isolated CC particles are dominated in the CC/PP
   samples with low CC (5 vol.%) loading. It was shown that practically
   full MMT exfoliation within polyethylene (PE) matrix can be achieved by
   both polymerization exfoliation method and by melt mixing compounding
   with using special polar polymer additions.

AB The data on the cathodic PdCo/C catalyst prepared by high-temperature
   synthesis from 20 wt % Pd/C (E-TEK) are shown. According to XRD data,
   the catalyst represents an alloy with the preferential composition of
   Pd2Co. The kinetics and mechanism of oxygen reduction on the PdCo/C
   catalyst are studied by the methods of rotating disk electrode,
   rotating ring-disk electrode, and electrochemical impedance. It is
   shown that oxygen is reduced preferentially to water (k(1)) but in the
   potential range more negative than 0.6 V, the ratio of constants
   k(1)/k(2) decreases, which suggests that the contribution of the
   reaction that proceeds through the formation of H2O2 (k(2)) increases.
   The activity of PdCo/C catalyst under model conditions in 0.5 M H2SO4
   was assessed to be 15 mA/mg(cat) at a potential of 0.7 V.

   hydrogen was studied in high-vacuum experiments by the "nanolaboratory"
   method. The dependences of the rate of platinum oxidation on the

   measured and interpreted. The possibility of field-induced reversible
   changes in the atomic structure of oxide phases was demonstrated. For
   the first time, applied field polarity dependent autooscillations of
   chemical reactions accelerated by the field that occurred in the
   interaction of molecular hydrogen with PtO (x) were observed. The
   results obtained, which modeled the influence of the charges of small
   metal particles on their catalytic activity, introduced a new size
   parameter into the theory of deposited catalysts. This parameter
   determined maximum sizes of nanoparticles whose reactivity depended on
   their charge state.

   that silver nanoparticles in samples based on strongly basic anion
   exchangers and weakly basic anion exchangers in the NO (3) (-) salt
   form are not oxidized by oxygen; for weakly basic matrices in the free
   amine form, this process occurs to only a small extent. The resistance
   to oxygen is explained by inhibition of processes of formation of

AB Selenium-containing nanostructures of rigid-chain polymers with close

   0.1 in solution. The group of polymers under study included the

   poly-N,N,N,N-trimethylmethacryloyloxyethylammonium methyl sulfate,
   anionic polyelectrolyte carboxymethylcellulose, and nonionogen polymer
   oxyethylcellulose. High-molecular selenium-containing polymer
   nanostructures were found in all cases. Nanostructures with a maximum
   molecular mass and the largest number of constituent macromolecules
   were obtained using oxyethylcellulose. At nu = 0.1 the mean square
   radii of inertia of the nanostructures were almost independent of the
   nature of the polymer matrix. The thermodynamic state of the solutions
   of nanostructures was close to the ideal one in all cases. For the
   region where stable dispersions formed, the Gibbs energies of
   macromolecule-selenium nanoparticle interactions were calculated and
   shown to be almost independent of the nature of the polymer matrix at
   nu = 0.1. The close mean square radii of inertia R (g) (*) of the
   nanostructures, the Gibbs energies of interaction, and the equivalence
   of the thermodynamic state of the solutions of nanostructures obtained
   for all polymer matrices at nu = 0.1 suggest that nu = 0.1 corresponds
   to the ultimate adsorption capacity of selenium nanoparticles; the
   considerable differences between the molecular masses (for close R (g)

AB We report experimental and theoretical studies of the optical
   properties of composite nanoparticles consisting of a noble-metal (Ag
   or Au) core and a cyanine dye J-aggregate shell. Using transmission
   electron microscopy, the particles have been shown to be spherical in
   shape and 4 - 10 nm in size. The crystal structure of their core has
   been determined by 1-keV electron diffraction. The absorption spectra
   of such nanoparticles in aqueous suspension show two peaks, one due to
   the plasmon resonance in the metallic core, and the other to electronic
   excitations in the J-aggregate shell. These results are interpreted in
   a model based on the expression for the absorption cross section of
   small particles, using polarisability calculations for two concentric
   spheres with allowance for the size effect on the dielectric function
   of the metallic core. The dielectric function of the J-aggregates is
   derived from experimental data using Kramers - Kronig relations. The
   shape and position of the peaks in the absorption spectra of the hybrid
   nanoparticles are strongly dependent on their geometry and the optical
   properties of the core and shell materials. This offers the possibility
   of controlling the optical properties of composite materials based on
   such nanoparticles.

AB Human serum albumin (HSA) adsorbed onto silica nanoparticles modified
   by 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) and polyethyleneimine (PEI) was
   investigated by differential scanning calorimetry, IR spectroscopy, and
   photon correlation spectroscopy. The structural alterations of the
   protein molecules induced from adsorption process were estimated on the
   basis of temperatures of denaturation transition (T (d)) of the protein
   in free (native) and adsorbed form. It was found that adsorption of the
   protein onto the APTES-modified silica nanoparticles results in an
   increase in the temperature of denaturation transition from 42 to 47.4
   A degrees C. HSA adsorbed onto the PEI-modified silica nanoparticles
   unfolds extensively.

AB Properties of hypothetical planar silica polymorphs are investigated.
   First, the general topological features of possible atomically thin
   two-dimensional silica nanostructures are analyzed. On the basis of
   this analysis, two fundamental structure types (termed tetragonal and
   trigonal) that represent the possible local topological arrangements
   are chosen for a plane-wave density functional theory study. Whereas
   the trigonal motif is energetically favorable for the formation of
   monomolecular films and spherical fullerene-like nanoclusters, the
   tetragonal structure is more suitable for single-walled nanotubes of
   silica. The strain energy of trigonal films results entirely from
   two-membered rings, allowing us to estimate the energy cost of two-ring
   formation (1.30 eV), excluding any additional strain contribution from
   the environment. All structures possess strong dielectric properties
   with a band gap only slightly smaller than that in a-quartz and other
   bulk forms of silica. Reorganization of the band structure is seen; it
   is especially pronounced when two-membered rings are present in the
   system. The results of our calculations and other studies are brought
   together in order to grasp a better view on the place that these
   nanostructures occupy within the diversity of silica forms, with a
   conclusion that they lie well within the experimentally accessible
   range of total energies. From this, we infer that a segment of the
   (6,0) nanotube is the "ground-state" configuration for (SiO2)(N)
   clusters with N >= 36.

AB The X-band electron paramagnetic resonance in La0.5Ca0.5MnO3 was
   studied. Fitting the measured temperature dependence of the EPR
   linewidth and intensity to established models were employed to probe
   the effects of finite-size and nonstoichiometry. Regarding these
   effects, the complex mixed magnetic ordering inherent in bulk samples
   was shown to be unstable. The antiferromagnetic (AFM) and charge
   ordered component is suppressed in nanosamples. But the ferromagnetic
   (FM) state, appearing in nanograins, is frustrated due to (i) an
   AFM-like core-shell interaction and (ii) a strong spin disorder at the
   surfaces and core-shell transition layers. In addition, a weak
   nonstoichiometry which does not affect the crystal structure in bulk
   induces a strong decrease of the FM component in its magnetic ground
   state. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics. [doi:10.1063/1.3335949]

AB Pulsed electric discharges (PED) in water attract growing attention of
   researchers during last decades. It is caused both by fundamental
   aspects and by their possible application in medicine, biology,
   ecology, and pharmacology.
   At IEE RAS for last twenty years, the investigations both
   elcctrophysical parameters of PED and physical, chemical, and
   biological properties of the water treated by PED were carried out. It
   was established and confirmed that PED of 0.2-27 mu s duration at a
   current 30-1200 A and current rate 10(6)-10(9) A/s have temperature of
   oxygen - hydrogen plasma in their channel similar to 104 K; PED are
   accompanied by UV irradiation with wave length of 200 - 300 nm; at
   early stage of the discharge the shock waves with a speed up to similar
   to 5000 m/s are generated; at UV irradiation the photolysis reaction,
   i.e. generation of H2O2, OH radicals, O, O-3 and other chemically
   active substances takes place. All factors above destroy wide range of
   pathogen microbes, including spores of microscopic fungi, which are
   steadiest against adverse surrounding conditions.
   For the first time it was found that the prolonged microbic resistance
   of water (PMRW) treated by PED is caused by toxic ions and
   nanostructurcs of electrode metal. It was shown that the surface
   electric charge of the nanostructures plays essential role in PMRW too.
   Quantitative relations between: bactericidal action of water and mass
   concentration of nanoparticles in dependence on input electric energy
   and metal of electrodes; properties of nanoparticles as a function of
   PED duration and other initial parameters had been established.
   It is supposed to carry out further investigations of nanostructures
   water dispersions interaction with biological objects including tumoral
   tissues.

AB In analogy with macroscopic metal samples, crystallization of metal
   nanoparticles may occur appreciably below the thermodynamic melting
   temperature, T-m (this temperature depends on the particle size), while
   melting occurs at T-m. If the surface melting is suppressed,
   nanoparticles can be overheated during melting. We describe these
   effects by using the classical nucleation theory and assuming that the
   nucleation starts at the particle corners or edges. The corresponding
   undercooling or overheating temperature intervals are found to be about
   0.1T(m) for corners and 0.15T(m) for edges. These values are,
   respectively, two and one and a half times smaller than that for
   macroscopic samples. Under certain conditions, crystallization and
   melting can be controlled by the propagation of the front of a new
   phase. The corresponding temperature interval is found to be very
   narrow (about 0.02T(m)). (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nearly monodisperse CuCr2Se4 hexagon-shaped nanoparticles with

   decomposition of metal chlorides and selenium powder in oleylamine. In
   addition, the 'flower'-shaped CuCr2Se4 nanoparticles with a crystallite
   size 19.8 nm were also fabricated under similar conditions using
   heptanoic acid. Magnetic measurements show that all samples reveal
   ferromagnetic behavior below 350 K. The 'flower'-shaped nanoparticles
   have saturation magnetization, coercivity and remanent magnetization
   higher than the hexagon-shaped nanoparticles. However, the Curie
   temperature of the 'flower'-shaped nanoparticles (approximate to 380 K)
   is somewhat lower than in the hexagon-shaped nanoparticles (420-430 K).
   These phenomena may be associated with the shape and surface anisotropy
   which would exert a tremendous influence on the particle's magnetic

   65%, respectively. An average size of graphitic sheets forming the
   coating on metallic cores and the carbon matrix was estimated by the
   results of quantum-chemical calculations on graphene fragments to be

AB We have obtained experimental low-frequency Raman spectra for light
   scattering by nanoparticles of para-dichlorobenzene of size similar to
   300-70 nm. As their sizes decrease, the line frequencies decrease. The
   size of the nanoparticles was determined using an electron microscope.
   We found that in the lattice vibrational spectrum of nanoparticles of
   size 300-70 nm, a summed spectrum appears from
   alpha-para-dichlorobenzene and beta-para-dichlorobenzene. This is
   consistent with molecular dynamics calculations of the structure of the
   nanoparticle and calculations of the histograms for the lattice

AB The nonlinear scattering of light under the conditions of optical
   limiting of nanosecond pulsed laser radiation at a wavelength of 1064
   nm in a nanodiamond (ND) hydrosol has been experimentally studied.
   Superstable hydrosols were obtained from detonation NDs with a modified
   surface. Using an improved scheme of z scanning, it is shown that a
   decrease in the optical transmission coefficient of an ND hydrosol
   under optical limiting conditions is due to enhanced nonlinear
   scattering. It is established that the energy of pulsed radiation
   scattered at a right angle obeys a power law in dependence on the
   energy density of incident radiation pulses. Hydrosols of detonation
   NDs with the modified surface exhibit high stability with respect to
   the periodic laser action at high power density.

AB The theoretical foundations of technology for synthesizing overlength
   carbon nanotubes (i.e., nanotubes of length in ones and tens of cm)
   were developed that are promising for use as catalyst carriers, heavy
   duty cables, micro-mechanical activators, electrode components,
   composite materials, and so on. It was shown that to obtain overlength
   nanotubes CVD (chemical vapor deposition) technology employing a number
   of additional conditions (placement of the catalyst nanoparticles at a
   specified and controlled distance from one another, electromagnetic
   heating of the substrate, and choosing a gas-phase carbon carrier) is
   optimal. Technical ways to achieve these conditions are outlined.

AB Using transmission and scanning electron microscopy, the shape and
   particle size of nanopowders (NP) of silicon carbide and pyrolytic
   carbon are determined. The results are compared with other methods of
   analyzing the dimensional characteristics of NPs, and their tendency to
   aggregation is analyzed. It is established that silicon carbide NPs in
   the state of delivery are presented by globular aggregates from 0.1 to
   1 mu m in size which are formed by faced nanoparticles that are
   preferentially 50-70 nm in size. The latter are characterized by
   octahedron-, cube-, and intermediate-shaped facing; i.e., the tendency
   for rounded edges and vertexes and the formation of convex faces is
   observed. Nanoparticles of pyrolytic graphite form aggregates up to
   150-200 nm in size containing globular particles 30-40 nm in size.

DE nanopowders; pulsed electron beam; evaporation
AB Based on practical experience, the installation for production of metal
   oxide nanopowders is updated. The method involves evaporation of the
   target by a pulsed electron beam, condensation of the vapors of the
   material in a low-pressure gas, and deposition of nanopowders on a cold
   large-area crystallizer. In a new installation, a higher-power electron
   gun with a hollow cathode, which ensures the formation of the current
   pulse of the electron beam with an amplitude up to 1 A and a duration
   of 100 mu s, and a crystallizer of a larger diameter (0.3 m) and length
   (0.5 m), which makes it possible to decrease the agglomeration of
   nanoparticles, are used. The results of the evaporation of targets made
   of YSZ and CeGdO (x) are presented. The proposed method makes it
   possible to obtain nanopowders of oxides with a characteristic particle
   size of 3-5 nm and agglomerates consisting of them 20-600 nm in size,
   specific surfaces of up to 250 m(2)/g, productivity of up to 10 g/h,

AB Stomaflex elastomers filled with two types of magnetic particles (nano-
   and micro-sized) were investigated. It was observed that doping with
   Fe3O4 nanoparticles and applying a magnetic field during the
   polymerisation process led to a significant change in the local
   structure of the elastomer. Decreases in the quasi-crystalline phase
   concentration, in the average size of the crystalline blocks, and in
   the ordering distance were observed after doping the elastomer with
   magnetite nanoparticles. After filling the polymer with Fe3O4
   nanoparticles, yet the elastomer fractal dimension changes. For the
   elastomer filled with a large amount of Fe microparticles (75% particle
   concentration) a texture effect is observed, and this effect is larger
   for the samples polymerised in a magnetic field. At all microparticle
   concentrations, these elastomers exhibit surface fractal structure.
