AB Carbon nanotubes have shown promise as contrast agents for
   photoacoustic and photothermal imaging of tumours and infections
   because they offer high resolution and allow deep tissue imaging.
   However, in vivo applications have been limited by the relatively low
   absorption displayed by nanotubes at near-infrared wavelengths and
   concerns over toxicity. Here, we show that gold-plated carbon
   nanotubes-termed golden carbon nanotubes-can be used as photoacoustic
   and photothermal contrast agents with enhanced near-infrared contrast
   (similar to 10(2)-fold) for targeting lymphatic vessels in mice using
   extremely low laser fluence levels of a few mJ cm(-2).
   Antibody-conjugated golden carbon nanotubes were used to map the
   lymphatic endothelial receptor, and preliminary in vitro viability
   tests show golden carbon nanotubes have minimal toxicity. This new
   nanomaterial could be an effective alternative to existing
   nanoparticles and fluorescent labels for non-invasive targeted imaging
   of molecular structures in vivo.

AB The spread of cancer cells between organs, a process known as
   metastasis, is the cause of most cancer deaths(1,2). Detecting
   circulating tumour cells-a common marker for the development of
   metastasis(3,4)-is difficult because ex vivo methods are not sensitive
   enough owing to limited blood sample volume and in vivo diagnosis is
   time-consuming as large volumes of blood must be analysed(5-7). Here,
   we show a way to magnetically capture circulating tumour cells in the
   bloodstream of mice followed by rapid photoacoustic detection. Magnetic
   nanoparticles, which were functionalized to target a receptor commonly
   found in breast cancer cells, bound and captured circulating tumour
   cells under a magnet. To improve detection sensitivity and specificity,
   gold-plated carbon nanotubes conjugated with folic acid were used as a
   second contrast agent for photoacoustic imaging. By integrating in vivo
   multiplex targeting, magnetic enrichment, signal amplification and
   multicolour recognition, our approach allows circulating tumour cells
   to be concentrated from a large volume of blood in the vessels of
   tumour-bearing mice, and this could have potential for the early
   diagnosis of cancer and the prevention of metastasis in humans.

AB Silver nitrate oxidizes aniline in the solutions of nitric acid to
   conducting nanofibrillar polyaniline. Nanofibres of 10-20 nm thickness
   are assembled to brushes. Nanotubes, having cavities of various
   diameters, and nanorods have also been present in the oxidation
   products, as well as other morphologies. Metallic silver is obtained as
   nanoparticles of similar to 50 nm size accompanying macroscopic silver
   flakes. The reaction in 0.4 M nitric acid is slow and takes several
   weeks to reach 10-15% yield. It is faster in 1 M nitric acid; a high
   yield, 89% of theory, has been found after two weeks oxidation of 0.8 M
   aniline. The emeraldine structure of polyaniline has been confirmed by
   FTIR and UV-vis spectra. The resulting polyaniline-silver composites
   contain 50-80 wt.% of silver, close to the theoretical expectation of
   68.9 wt.% of silver. The highest conductivity was 2250 S cm(-1). The
   yield of a composite is lower when the reaction is carried out in dark,
   the effect of daylight being less pronounced at higher concentrations
   of reactants. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A comparative Study of the long-term gas-sensing performance of
   chemiresistors made of: (i) mats of randomly oriented single crystal
   SnO2 nanowires and (ii) thin layers of pristine SnO2 nanoparticles, has
   been carried Out. The sensing elements made of percolating nanowires
   demonstrate excellent sensitivity and long-term stability toward traces
   of 2-propanol in air. Different from the nanowire network, the superior
   initial sensitivity of the nanoparticle layer deteriorates during the
   first month of the operation and approaches to one observed steadily in
   the nanowire mats. The better stability of the nanowire mats sensors is
   explained in framework of reduced propensity of the single crystal
   nanowires to sinter under real world operation conditions with respect
   to nanoparticle thin film. At the microscopic level, the letter defines
   the stability of the percolating paths, analyte delivery and
   transduction mechanism in nanowire network sensing elements. (C) 2009

AB Nanoparticle plasmonics is a rapidly emerging research field that deals
   with the fabrication and optical characterization of noble metal
   nanoparticles of various size, shape, structure, and tunable plasmon
   resonances over VIS-NIR spectral band. The recent simultaneous advances
   in synthesis, characterization, electromagnetic simulation, and surface
   functionalization of plasmonic nanoparticles by biospecific molecular
   probes have led to a perfect publication storm in discoveries and
   potential biomedical applications of plasmon-resonant nanoparticle
   bioconjugates. Here, we present an overview of these topics. First, we
   discus basic wet-chemical routes to fabricate conjugates of gold,
   silver, or composite particles with controllable size, shape, structure
   and with surface functionalization by biospecific molecules. Second, we
   consider the single-particle dipole and multipole optics and coupled
   plasmonic nanoparticle arrays. Finally, we discus application of
   plasmonic bioconjugates to such fields as homogeneous and solid-phase
   assays, biomedical sensing and imaging, biodistribution and toxicity
   aspects, drug delivery and plasmonic photothermal therapy. (C) 2009

AB Kinetics, biodistribution, and histological studies were performed to
   evaluate the particle-size, effects on the distribution of 15 nm and 50
   nm PEG-coated colloidal gold (CG) particles and 160 nm silica/gold
   nanoshells (NSs) in rats and rabbits. The above nanoparticles (NPs)
   were used as a model because of their importance for current biomedical
   applications such as photothermal therapy, optical coherence
   tomography, and resonance-scattering imaging. The dynamics of NPs
   circulation in vivo was evaluated after intravenous administration of
   15 nm CG NPs to rabbit, and the maximal concentrations of gold were
   observed 15-30 min after injection. Rats were injected in the tail vein
   with PEG-coated NPs (about 0.3 mg Au/kg rats). 24 h after injection,
   the accumulation of gold in different organs and blood was determined
   by atomic absorption spectroscopy. In accordance with the published
   reports, we observed 15 nm particles in all organs with rather smooth
   distribution over liver, spleen and blood. By contrast, the larger NSs
   were accumulated mainly in the liver and spleen. For rabbits, the
   biodistribution was similar (72 h after intravenous injection). We
   report also preliminary data on the light microscopy and TEM
   histological examination that allows evaluation of the changes in
   biotissues after gold NPs treatment. (C) 2009 by WILEYNCH Verlag GmbH &

   (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Trichoderma asperellum) with
   polyelectrolytes poly(allylamine hydrochloride)/sodium poly(styrene
   sulfonate) and bovine serum albumin/DNA and citrate-stabilized gold and
   silver nanoparticles. It was found that the nanoparticles were
   effectively incorporated between oppositely charged polyelectrolyte
   layers, modifying the topography and the roughness of cell walls. The
   formation of large aggregates of nanoparticles on the cell walls of
   encapsulated cells was shown. It was found that the encapsulated cells
   preserved their viability and the shells were soft enough to allow the
   growth of mycelium. The surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) was
   used to investigate the biochemical environments of the gold and silver
   nanoparticles immobilized on the surface of T. asperellum conidia, The
   SERS spectra from encapsulated conidia and polyelectrolytes indicate
   that both gold and silver nanoparticles interact with cell walls from
   different locations, and nanoparticle-polyelectrolyte interaction is
   limited. The approach described in this paper might have potential
   applications in modification of living cells.

AB Stem cells hold great potential as cell-based therapies to promote
   vascularization and tissue regeneration. However, the use of stem cells
   alone to promote angiogenesis remains limited because of insufficient
   expression of angiogenic factors and low cell viability after
   transplantation. Here, we have developed vascular endothelial growth
   factor (VEGF) high-expressing, transiently modified stem cells for the
   purposes of promoting angiogenesis. Nonviral, biodegradable polymeric
   nanoparticles were developed to deliver hVEGF gene to human mesenchymal
   stem cells (hMSCs) and human embryonic stem cell-derived cells
   (hESdCs). Treated stem cells demonstrated markedly enhanced hVEGF
   production, cell viability, and engraftment into target tissues. S. c.
   implantation of scaffolds seeded with VEGF-expressing stem cells (hMSCs
   and hESdCs) led to 2- to 4-fold-higher vessel densities 2 weeks after
   implantation, compared with control cells or cells transfected with
   VEGF by using Lipofectamine 2000, a leading commercial reagent. Four
   weeks after intramuscular injection into mouse ischemic hindlimbs,
   genetically modified hMSCs substantially enhanced angiogenesis and limb
   salvage while reducing muscle degeneration and tissue fibrosis. These
   results indicate that stem cells engineered with biodegradable polymer
   nanoparticles may be therapeutic tools for vascularizing tissue
   constructs and treating ischemic disease.

AB This report introduces a novel diagnostic and therapeutic platform for
   in vivo non-invasive detection and treatment of metastases in sentinel
   lymph nodes (SLNs) at single cell level using an integrated system of
   multicolor photoacoustic (PA) lymph flow cytometry, PA lymphography,
   absorption image cytometry, and photothermal (PT) therapy. A
   melanoma-bearing mouse model was used to demonstrate the capability of
   this platform for real-time lymphatic mapping, counting of disseminated
   tumor cells (DTCs) in prenodal lymphatics, and detecting metastasis in
   SLNs and its purging. The detection and ablation of non-pigmented
   breast cancer cells in SLNs was achieved by labeling them with
   nanoparticles. The association between DTC count and SLN metastasis
   progression supports lymphatic DTCs as a novel prognostic marker of
   metastasis. The fiber-based portable PA device may replace the
   conventional SLN(s) excision and histology-based staging. The earliest
   detection of DTCs in the lymphatic vessels before the establishment of
   nodal metastasis may prevent metastasis by well-timed ablation of DTCs.

AB The paper reviews recent progress in the field of microwave magnetic
   properties of composites. The problem under discussion is developing
   composites with high microwave permeability that are needed in many
   applications. The theory of magnetic composites is briefly sketched
   with the attention paid to the laws governing the magnetic frequency
   dispersion in magnetic materials and basic mixing rules for composites.
   Recent experimental reports on the microwave performance of magnetic
   composites, as well as data on the agreement of the mixing rules with
   the measured permeability of composites that are available from the
   literature are discussed. From the data, a conclusion is made that the
   validity of a mixing rule is determined by the permeability contrast in
   the composite, i.e., the difference between permeability of inclusions
   and that of the host matrix. When the contrast is low, the Maxwell
   Garnet mixing rule is frequently valid. When the contrast is high,
   which is of the most interest for obtaining high microwave permeability
   of a composite, no conventionally accepted theory is capable of
   accurately predicting the permeability of the composites. Therefore,
   the mixing rules do not allow the microwave properties of magnetic
   composites to be predicted when the permeability of inclusions is high,
   that is the case of the most interest. Because of that, general
   limitations to the microwave performance of composites are of
   importance. In particular, an important relation constraining the
   microwave permeability of composites follows from Kittel's theory of
   ferromagnetic resonance and analytical properties of frequency
   dependence of permeability. Another constraint concerning the bandwidth
   of electromagnetic wave absorbers follows from the Kramers-Kronig
   relations for the reflection coefficient. The constraints are of
   importance in design and analysis of electromagnetic wave absorbers and
   other devices that employ the microwave magnetic properties of
   composites, such as magnetic substrates for microwave antennas,
   microwave inductors, etc. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) is a modern high-resolution
   optical technique providing detailed image of tissue structure with
   high (down to microns) spatial resolution. Aiming at a concurrent
   improvement of imaging depth and image quality of CLSM requires the use
   of contrast agents. Commonly employed fluorescent contrast agents, such
   as fluorescent dyes and proteins, suffer from toxicity, photo-bleaching
   and overlapping with the tissues autofluorescence. Gold nanoparticles
   are potentially highly attractive to be applied as a contrast agent
   since they are not subject to photo-bleaching and can target
   biochemical cells markers associated with the specific diseases. In
   current report we consider the applicability of gold nanospheres as a
   contrast agent to enhance quality of CLSM images of skin tissues in
   vitro versus the application of optical clearing agent, such as
   glycerol. The enhancement of CLSM image contrast was observed with an
   application of gold nano-spheres diffused within the skin tissues. We
   show that optical clearing agents such as a glycerol provide better
   CLSM image contrast than gold nano-spheres.

AB This paper presents some important results of the studies on
   preparation and catalytic properties of nanodispersed Au/Al2O3
   catalysts for low-temperature CO oxidation, which are carried out at
   the Boreskov Institute of Catalysis (BIC) starting from 2001. The
   catalysts with a gold loading of 1-2 wt.% were prepared via deposition
   of Au complexes onto different aluminas by means of various techniques
   ("deposition-precipitation" (DP), incipient wetness, "chemical
   liquid-phase grafting" (CLPG), chemical vapor deposition (CVD)). These
   catalysts have been characterized comparatively by a number of physical
   methods (XRD, TEM, diffuse reflectance UV/vis and XPS) and
   catalytically tested for combustion of CO impurity (1%) in wet air
   stream at near-ambient temperature. Using the hydroxide or chloride
   gold complexes capable of chemical interaction with the surface groups
   of alumina as the catalyst precursors (DP and incipient wetness
   techniques, respectively) produces the catalysts that contain metallic
   Au particles mainly of 2-4 nm in diameter, uniformly distributed
   between the external and internal surfaces of the support granules
   together with the surface "ionic" Au oxide species. Application of
   organogold precursors gives the supported Au catalysts of egg shell
   type which are either close by mean Au particle size to what we obtain
   by DP and incipient wetness techniques (CVD of (CH3)(2)Au(acac) vapor
   on highly dehydrated Al2O3 in a rotating reactor under static
   conditions) or contain Au crystallites of no less than 7 nm in size
   (CLPG method). Regardless of deposition technique, only the Cl-free
   Au/Al2O3 catalysts containing the small Au particles (d(i) <= 5 nm)
   reveal the high catalytic activity toward CO oxidation under
   near-ambient conditions, the catalyst stability being provided by
   adding the water vapor into the reaction feed. The results of testing
   of the nanodispersed Au/Al2O3 catalysts under conditions which simulate
   in part removal of CO from ambient air or diesel exhaust are discussed
   in comparison with the data obtained for the commercial Pd and Pt
   catalysts under the same conditions. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB We report on the formation of self-organized nanostructures (NS) on
   bulk Al under its ablation in air and liquids with femtoseconds (fs)
   laser pulses. In case of exposure into liquids, NS are regularly formed
   on the Al surface with an average period of about 200 nm, independent
   of the laser polarization. A dispersion of Al nanoparticles (NPs) into
   the liquid additionally occurs. Irregular nano-bumps are produced when
   the irradiation is performed in air. NP dispersions as well as NS
   formed on Al surface show a characteristic absorption peak in the near
   UV which has been attributed to plasmon oscillation of electrons. The
   wings of this peak extending to the visible, lead to a distinct yellow
   coloration of the processed Al surface and the liquid dispersions.
   Ultrafast laser processing of bulk Al in liquids may be potentially a
   promising technique for efficient production of nanosized aluminum. (C)

AB Novel nanomaterials are being developed to improve diagnosis and
   therapy of diseases through effective delivery of drugs,
   biopharmaceutical molecules and imaging agents to target cells in
   disease sites. Such diagnostic and therapeutic nanomaterials, also
   termed "nanomedicines", often require site-specific cellular entry to
   deliver their payload to sub-cellular locations hidden beneath cell
   membranes. Nanomedicines can employ multiple pathways for cellular
   entry, which are currently insufficiently understood. This
   review,first, classifies various mechanisms of endocytosis available to
   nanomedicines including phagocytosis and pinocytosis through
   clathrin-dependent and clathrin-independent pathways. Second, it
   describes the current experimental tools to study endocytosis of
   nanomedicines. Third, it provides specific examples from recent
   literature and our own work on endocytosis of nanomedicines. Finally,
   these examples are used to ascertain 1) the role of particle size,
   shape, material composition, surface chemistry and/or charge for
   utilization of a selected pathway(s); 2) the effect of cell type on the
   processing of nanomedicines; and 3) the effect of nanomaterial-cell
   interactions on the processes of endocytosis, the fate of the
   nanomedicines and the resulting cellular responses. This review will be
   useful to a diverse audience of students and scientists who are
   interested in understanding endocytosis of nanomedicines. (c) 2010

AB We propose a simple method for the efficient and rapid synthesis of
   one-dimensional hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) nanostructures based on
   electrical resistive heating of iron wire under ambient conditions.
   Typically, 1-5 mu m long alpha-Fe2O3 nanowires were synthesized on a
   time scale of seconds at temperatures of around 700 degrees C. The
   morphology, structure, and mechanism of formation of the nanowires were
   studied by scanning and transmission electron microscopies, energy
   dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and
   Raman techniques. A nanowire growth mechanism based on diffusion of
   iron ions to the surface through grain boundaries and to the growing
   wire tip through stacking fault defects and due to surface diffusion is
   proposed.

AB Highly stable aluminum nanoparticles (NPs) are generated via ablation
   of bulk Al in ethanol using either femtosecond (fs) or picosecond (ps)
   laser sources. The colloidal NPs solutions obtained with fs pulses
   exhibit a yellow coloration and show an increased optical absorption
   between 300 and 400 nm, tentatively assigned to the plasmon resonance
   of nanosized Al. The corresponding solutions after ps ablation are gray
   colored and opalescent. The average size of the NPs formed ranges from
   20 nm for the fs case to 60 nm for the ps case, while a narrower
   distribution is obtained using the shorter pulses. High Resolution
   Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) studies indicate that the NPs
   are mostly amorphous with single crystalline inclusions. Al NPs
   generated with short laser pulses slowly react with air oxygen due to
   the presence of a native oxide cladding, which efficiently passivates
   their surface against further oxidation. (C) 2009 Optical Society of

AB Colloidal stability is one of the critical factors for the use of
   nanodiamonds as potential enterosorbents. Although nanodiamonds are
   believed to be a promising enterosorbent, colloidal stability in
   hydrosols of raw polydispersed nanodiamonds produced by detonation is
   typically low. Surface modification and fractionation significantly
   improves colloidal stability of nanodiamond suspensions within the
   physiological pH range. The modification of nanodiamonds can be
   completed either by physical means, i.e.. plasma treatments. or by
   chemical methods, in the current paper an analysis of the colloidal
   stability of detonation nanodiamonds hydrosols, which have undergone
   different surface modifications, is presented based on zeta potential
   measurements and titration experiments. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles coated with poloxamer
   188 (Pluronic (R) F-68) or polysorbate 80 (Tween (R) 80) enable an
   efficient brain delivery of the drugs after intravenous injection. This
   ability was evidenced by two different pharmacological test systems
   employing as model drugs the anti-tumour antibiotic doxorubicin and the
   agonist of opioid receptors loperamide, which being P-gp substrates can
   cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) only in pharmacologically
   insignificant amounts: binding of doxorubicin to the surfactant-coated
   PLGA nanoparticles, however, enabled a high anti-tumour effect against
   an intracranial 101/8 glioblastoma in rats, and the penetration of
   nanoparticle-bound loperamide into the brain was demonstrated by the
   induction of central analgesic effects in mice. Both pharmacological
   tests could demonstrate that therapeutic amounts of the drugs were
   delivered to the sites of action in the brain and showed the high
   efficiency of the surfactant-coated PLGA nanoparticles for brain
   delivery. The results of the study also demonstrated that the efficacy
   of brain delivery by nanoparticles not only is influenced by the
   coating surfactants but also by other formulation parameters such as
   core polymer, drug, and stabilizer. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Recent developments in biomineralization have already demonstrated that
   nanosized crystals and particles play an important role in the
   formation of hard tissues of animals Namely, it is well established
   that the basic inorganic building blocks of bones and teeth of mammals
   are nanosized and nanocrystalline calcium orthophosphates in the form
   of apatites. In mammals. tens to hundreds nanocrystals of a biological
   apatite have been found to be combined into self-assembled structures
   under the control of bioorganic matrixes Therefore, application and
   prospective use of the nanosized and nanocrystalline calcium
   orthophosphates for a clinical repair of damaged bones and teeth are
   also well known For example, greater viability and better proliferation
   of various types of cells have been detected on smaller crystals of
   calcium orthophosphates Thus. the nanosized and nanocrystalline forms
   of calcium orthophosphates have great potential to revolutionize the
   hard tissue-engineering field, starting from bone repair and
   augmentation to controlled drug delivery systems This paper reviews the
   Current state of art and recent developments Of Various nanosized and
   nanocrystalline calcium orthophosphates, starting from synthesis and
   characterization to biomedical and clinical applications. The review
   also provides possible directions for future research and development

TI Optically Enhanced Emission of Localized Excitons in InxGa1-xN Films by

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS

DT Article
ID QUANTUM DOTS; FLUORESCENCE; DEVICE
AB We report on strong site-selective enhancement of the emission of
   localized excitons in an InxGa1-xN film, induced by resonant coupling
   to a single plasmon confined in a gold nanoparticle. The particle was
   attached to an atomic-force-microscope probe and placed at the
   near-field distance of the surface. The observation is explained by the
   enhancement of the spontaneous emission recombination rate of the
   excitons due to the local increase in the photonic mode density near
   the metal particle. The interpretation is consistent with the intensity
   increase and lifetime shortening of the emission observed in the same
   film with deposited Au clusters. We show that the nanoscale roughness
   of the film is an important prerequisite of the efficient plasmonic
   enhancement.

AB The effect of silica/gold nanoshells and titanium dioxide nanoparticles
   on the optical properties of skin is studied. By implementing in vivo
   measurements and Monte Carlo simulations, we analyze the efficiency of
   using these nanoparticles as contrasting agents for optical coherence
   tomography (OCT) imaging of skin. In vivo measurements are performed on
   pig skin, where nanoparticle suspension drops have been applied. The
   identification of skin layers is performed by comparison with
   corresponding histology images. Experimental results exhibit an
   increase in contrast of the obtained OCT images after a single
   nanoparticles application. Multiple applications do not lead to
   increase in the obtained contrast. To interpret the obtained
   experimental OCT images of skin and understand the mechanisms of
   contrasting, a set of Monte Carlo calculations is performed. The
   results of the simulations exhibit good qualitative agreement with the
   experimental images, and prove that the contrasting originates from the
   nanoparticles added, while the contrast of inclusion originates from
   the absence of nanoparticles within it and their presence in the
   surrounding area. (C) 2009 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation

AB By carefully controlling the reacting conditions, including atmosphere,
   temperature, and time, alpha-Fe2O3 nanoleaves have been synthesized by
   oxygenating pure iron. X-ray diffraction and transmission electronic
   microscope analyses demonstrate that the nanoleaves are single
   crystalline. The X-ray photoelectron spectrum, Raman spectrum. optical
   absorption spectrum, and photoluminescence spectrum are also carried
   out to characterize the nanoleaves. Magnetic measurement shows that the
   blocking temperature of the nanoleaves is about 120K and the coercivity
   decreases as temperature increases. The more interesting is that a
   small exchange bias is found in 2T field cooling hysteresis loops. This
   small exchange bias may possibly originate from a different magnetic
   order on the surface of the nanoleaves or the coexistence of a tiny
   amount of Fe3O4. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this letter the onset temperature of surface premelting, T-sm, is
   determined in terms of the mean-field approximation. There are
   established relationships, describing the dependence of T-sm, on a
   characteristic size of nanoparticles. It is shown that if a radius of a
   particle, r, exceeds 10 nm approximately, this dependence is weak. On
   the contrary, it is strong if the radius of a particle is less than 5
   nm. The transition of surface layers into the quasi-liquid and

   the proposed model with available experimental data and with molecular
   dynamics simulations is carried out. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB We investigate the electronic and magnetic structures of Mn chains
   supported on a CuN surface, using first-principles LSDA and LDA+U
   methods. The isotropic exchange integrals and anisotropic
   Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions between Mn atoms are calculated
   using the Green's function technique and total energies difference
   method. It is shown that lattice relaxation and on-site Coulomb
   interaction are important for an accurate description of the magnetic
   properties of the investigated nanosystems. Based on a classical spin
   Hamiltonian we conclude that the Mn antiferromagnetic nanochains on the
   CuN surface demonstrate weak ferromagnetism. The net magnetic moment
   and direction of the spin canting are estimated in the framework of a
   classical spin Hamiltonian. We show that some aspects of the
   experimental spectrum can be explained using a quantum spin
   Hamiltonian, with parameters defined from first-principles calculations
   and extracted from recent STM experiments.

AB In this paper we discuss thermal stability of tin dioxide nanoparticles
   and long-term stability of the SnO2-based gas sensors. Relying on
   laser-spark element analysis and XRD analysis we compare crystallite
   growth kinetics of synthesized and commercial (Sigma-Aldrich) SnO2 with
   different impurity level. We found that commercial SnO2 nanopowder has
   lower thermal stability in comparison with synthesized one, resulting
   in higher crystallite growth rate and poly-dispersed particle size
   after annealing. A special attention is drawn to discussion of
   catalytic activity of the nanocrystalline materials. Using IR
   spectroscopy we studied chemical composition of the annealed materials,
   which allowed us to reveal in the synthesized SnO2 intensive formation
   of Sn-OH bonding during annealing. We performed temperature programmed
   reduction (TPR) analysis to compare the catalytic activity of the
   materials with and without deposited Pd on SnO2. Long-term stability of
   the sensors made on the basis of synthesized and commercial SnO2 was
   measured as a sensor signal deviation (luring 590 h of operation in
   0.2, 0.6 and 1.0 vol. % of propane in air (50% RH at 20 degrees C). (C)

AB This is a first case ever reported on the fullerene-based low toxic
   nanocationite particles (porphyrin adducts of cyclohexyl
   fullerene-C-60) designed for targeted delivery of the paramagnetic
   magnesium stable isotope to the heart muscle providing a sharp clinical
   effect close to about 80% recovery of the tissue hypoxia symptoms in
   less than 24 h after a single injection (0.03-0.1 LD50). A whole
   principle of this therapy is novel: Mg-25(2+)-magnetic isotope effect
   selectively stimulates the ATP overproduction in the oxygen-depleted
   cells due to Mg-25(2+) released by the nanoparticles. Being
   membranotropic cationites, these "smart nanoparticles" release the
   overactivating paramagnetic cations only in response to the metabolic
   acidic shift. The resulting positive changes in the heart cell energy
   metabolism may help to prevent and/or treat the local myocardial
   hypoxic disorders and, hence, protect the heart muscle from a serious
   damage in a vast variety of the hypoxia-caused clinical situations
   including both doxorubicin and 1-methylnicotineamide cardiotoxic side
   effects. Both pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drug
   proposed make it suitable for safe and efficient administration in
   either single or multi-injection (acute or chronic) therapeutic

AB A theoretical model is suggested which describes transition from
   plastic shear into rotation deformation mode - deformation accompanied
   by crystal lattice rotations - in nanocrystalline metals and ceramics.
   Within the model, the shear deformation occurs through either grain
   boundary sliding or lattice dislocation slip and results in formation
   of pile-ups of either grain boundary or lattice dislocations,
   respectively. The dislocation pile-ups create stress fields initiating
   the rotation deformation (occurring through formation of immobile
   disclinations whose strengths gradually increase during the formation
   process) in neighboring nanograins. These processes provide transition
   from plastic shear into rotation deformation mode in nanocrystalline
   metals and ceramics, including single-phase nanocrystalline materials
   with narrow and bimodal grain size distributions as well as
   nanocomposites consisting of microscale grains and nanoparticles. The
   conditions are calculated at which the transition is energetically
   favorable in nanocrystalline Ni and alpha-Al2O3 (corundum).

AB The purpose Of this Study was to introduce newly synthesized
   nanomaterials as an alternative to superparamagnetic ironoxide based
   particles (SPIO) and thus to launch a new platform for highly
   controllable hyperthermia cancer therapy and imaging. The new material
   that forms the basis for this article is lanthanum manganite particles
   with silver ions inserted into the perovskite lattice:
   La1-xAgxMnO3+delta. Adjusting the silver doping level, it is possible
   to control the Curie temperature (T-c) in the hyperthermia range of
   interest (41-44 degrees C). A new class of nanoparticles based on
   silver-doped manganites La1-xAgxMnO3+delta is Suggested. New
   nanoparticles are stable, and their properties were not affected by the
   typical ambient conditions in the living tissue. It is possible to
   monitor the particle uptake and retention by MRI. When these particles
   are placed into ail alternating magnetic field, their temperature
   increases to the definite value near T-c and then remains constant if
   the magnetic field is maintained. During the hyperthermia procedure,
   the temperature can be restricted, thereby preventing the necrosis of
   normal tissue. A new class of nanoparticles based on silver-doped
   manganites La1-xAgxMnO3+delta was Suggested. Ag-doped perovskite
   manganites particles clearly demonstrated the effect of adjustable
   Curie temperature necessary for highly controllable cellular
   hyperthermia. The magnetic relaxation properties of the particles are
   comparable with that of SPIO, and so we were able to monitor the
   particle movement and retention by MRI. Thus, the new material combines
   the MRI contrast enhancement capability with targeted hyperthermia
   treatment. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res 91A:

AB Structure analysis of a magnetic fluid (nanoparticles of maghemite
   dispersed in water with charge stabilization and without surfactant) by
   means of small-angle neutron scattering is presented. A combination of
   the contrast variation technique and scattering of polarized neutrons
   was applied. In the first case, the scattering curves obtained for the
   unmagnetized fluid with variation of the heavy water content in the
   carrier are treated in terms of the basic functions approach. The
   almost homogeneous character of the nanoparticles with respect to the
   nuclear scattering length density makes it possible to separate
   information about their characteristic nuclear and magnetic radii.
   Polarized neutrons are then used to separate and analyze independently
   the nuclear and magnetic scattering contributions for the fully
   magnetized fluid. Both methods reveal a significant excess of the
   apparent nuclear size over the magnetic one, which is explained by a
   difference in the nonmagnetic and magnetic interactions in the system.
   The results indicate that from the viewpoint of magnetic interaction
   the studied fluid behaves under a magnetic field as a purely
   superparamagnetic system of independent particles. The magnetic
   scattering length density of the maghemite nanoparticles is found to be
   similar to 25% less than the bulk value, which is in agreement with the
   data of the magnetization analysis.

AB Continuous flow capillary microreactors with embedded monometallic (Pd)

   hydrogenation of alkyne reagents. The catalysts were prepared in two
   steps. At first, polymer-stabilized metal nanoparticles (either Pd or
   Pd25Zn75) were prepared by the reduction by solvent method. Then, a
   solution of colloidal nanoparticles with a desired concentration was
   added into a titania sol, which was destabilized by solvent evaporation
   during dip-coating of the inner wall of a Fused silica capillary with
   an internal diameter of 250 mu m. The wall-coated microreactors were
   tested in the hydrogenation of 2-methyl-3-butyne-2-ol (0.011-0.45 M
   solution in methanol) fit the 328-337 K temperature range. The highest
   selectivity towards the alkene product of 90% was obtained at 99.9%
   conversion on the Pd25Zn75/TiO2 catalyst. The selectivity was further
   increased to 97% by addition of pyridine into the reactant solution. No
   deactivation of the wall-coated catalysts was observed during one month
   or continuous operation at 333 K.

AB The nerve growth factor (NGF) is essential for the survival of both
   peripheral ganglion cells and central cholinergic neurons in the basal
   forebrain. The accelerated loss of central cholinergic neurons during
   Alzheimer's disease may be a determinant cause of dementia, and this
   observation may suggest a possible therapeutic benefit from treatment
   with NGF. In recent years, convincing data have been published
   involving neurotrophic factors for the modulation of dopaminergic
   transmission within the brain and concerning the ability of NGF to
   prevent the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. In this connection,
   the administration of NGF may slow down the progression of Parkinson's
   disease. However, NGF, as well as other peptidic neurotrophic factors,
   does not significantly penetrate the blood-brain barrier (131313) from
   the circulation. Therefore, any clinical usefulness of NGF as a
   potential CNS therapy will depend on the use of a suitable carrier
   system that enhances its transport through the BBB. The present study
   investigates brain delivery of NGF adsorbed on poly(butyl
   cyanoacrylate) (PBCA) nanoparticles coated with polysorbate 80 and the
   pharmacological efficacy of this delivery system in the model of acute
   scopolamine-induced amnesia in rats as well as in the model of
   1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced
   Parkinsonian syndrome. As shown by the passive avoidance reflex (PAR)
   test, the intravenous administration of the nanoparticle-bound NGF
   successfully reversed scopolamine-induced amnesia and improved
   recognition and memory. This formulation also demonstrated a
   significant reduction of the basic symptoms of Parkinsonism
   (oligokinesia, rigidity, tremor). In addition, the efficient transport
   of NGF across the BBB was confirmed by direct measurement of NGF
   concentrations in the murine brain. These results demonstrate that the
   PBCA nanoparticles coated with polysorbate 80 are an effective carrier
   system for the transport of NGF to the central nervous system across
   the BBB following intravenous injection. This approach may improve the
   NGF-based therapy of age-related neurodegenerative diseases.

AB By means of ion bombardment of clean Au(111) films, atomically flat
   nanoparticles of various shapes and sizes were created, ranging from
   several tens of nm(2) down to only a few nm(2). Both two-dimensional Au
   islands as well as one-dimensional Au nanowire-like structures have
   been investigated by means of low-temperature scanning tunneling
   microscopy and spectroscopy. We were able to probe their local
   electronic structure in a broad energy range, which was found to be
   dominated by pronounced size-dependent confinement effects. Mapping of
   the local density of states revealed complex standing wave patterns
   that arise due to interference of scattered Au surface state electrons
   at the edges of the Au nanoparticles. The observed phenomena could be
   modeled with high accuracy by theoretical particle-in-a-box
   calculations based on a variational method that can be applied to '2D
   boxes' of arbitrary polygonal shape and that we have previously
   successfully applied to explain the electronic wave patterns on Co
   islands on Au(111). Our findings support the general validity of this
   particle-in-a-box model.

   of doxorubicin bound to polysorbate-coated nanoparticles that had
   previously been shown to significantly enhance survival in the
   orthotopic rat 101/8 glioblastoma model. Tumor-bearing animals were
   subjected to chemotherapy using doxorubicin in solution (Dox-sol) or
   doxorubicin bound to polysorbate 80-coated 8 post tumor implantation.
   The antitumor effect was assessed on Days 10, 14 and 18 post tumor
   implantation. Tumors showed signs of malignancy including invasion of
   brain tissue, brisk mitotic activity, microvascular proliferation,
   necrosis and increased proliferation resembling human glioblastoma.
   Dox-np produced a considerably more pronounced antitumor effect
   exhibited as a reduced tumor size, lower proliferation, and a decreased
   necrotic area compared to Dox-sol and to untreated control groups. A
   drastic effect of Dox-np on vascularization indicated an antiangiogenic
   mode of action.

AB This paper presents the results of combined investigation of the
   chemical bond formation in fluorinated multiwalled carbon nanotubes
   (MWCNTs) with different fluorine contents (10-55 wt %) and reference
   compounds (highly oriented pyrolytic graphite crystals and "white"
   graphite fluoride) using x-ray absorption and photoelectron
   spectroscopy at C 1s and F 1s thresholds. Measurements were performed
   at BESSY II (Berlin, Germany) and MAX-laboratory (Lund, Sweden). The
   analysis of the soft x-ray absorption and photoelectron spectra points
   to the formation of covalent chemical bonding between fluorine and
   carbon atoms in the fluorinated nanotubes. It was established that
   within the probing depth (similar to 15 nm) of carbon nanotubes, the
   process of fluorination runs uniformly and does not depend on the
   fluorine concentration. In this case, fluorine atoms interact with
   MWCNTs through the covalent attachment of fluorine atoms to graphene
   layers of the graphite skeleton (phase 1) and this bonding is
   accompanied by a change in the hybridization of the 2s and 2p valence
   electron states of the carbon atom from the trigonal (sp(2)) to
   tetrahedral (sp(3)) hybridization and by a large electron transfer
   between carbon an fluorine atoms. In the MWCNT near-surface region the
   second fluorine-carbon phase with weak electron transfer is formed; it
   is located mainly within two or three upper graphene monolayers, and
   its contribution becomes much poorer as the probing depth of
   fluorinated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (F-MWCNTs) increases. The
   defluorination process of F-MWCNTs on thermal annealing has been
   investigated. The conclusion has been made that F-MWCNT defluorination
   without destruction of graphene layers is possible.

   absorption and scattering of a single particle driven by plasmon
   resonance interactions in an aqueous medium are considered. Thermal
   effects produced by laser-irradiated nanoparticles, dynamics of vapor
   bubble formation, and acoustic signals from expanding bubbles formed
   around heated nanoparticles are calculated. Stochastic features of the
   pressure magnitude emitted as a result of low-fluence irradiation of
   suspensions are also discussed. The probabilistic distribution of
   pressure magnitude from individual bubbles was found to obey Zipf's law
   for low concentrations of nanoparticles, while increasing their
   concentration brings the pressure magnitude distribution into
   conformance with the Gaussian law. (C) 2008 Optical Society of America

   the in nanoparticles arc in aggregates, whose inner structure depends
   on the stabilizer used. In particular, an incomplete coating of

AB Using a new indirect nanoplasmonic sensing method with subsecond
   resolution, we have studied hydriding and dehydriding kinetics of Pd
   nanoparticles in the size range 1.8-5.4 nm. Strong particle-size
   effects are observed. The scaling of the hydriding and dehydriding time
   scales satisfies power and power-exponential laws. The former (with an
   exponent of 2.9) is in perfect agreement with Monte Carlo simulations
   of diffusion-controlled hydriding kinetics. The latter is explained by
   the effect of surface tension on hydrogen desorption from the surface
   layer. The approach is generalizable to other reactant-nanoparticle
   systems.

AB An efficient method to investigate the microstructure and spatial
   distribution of nitrogen and nitrogen-vacancy (N-V) defects in
   detonation nanodiamond (DND) with primary particle sizes ranging from
   approximately 3 to 50 nm is presented. Detailed analysis reveals atomic
   nitrogen concentrations as high as 3 at% in 50% of diamond primary
   particles with sizes smaller than 6 nm. A non-uniform distribution of
   nitrogen within larger primary DND particles is also presented,
   indicating a preference for location within the defective central part
   or at twin boundaries. A photoluminescence (PL) spectrum with
   well-pronounced zero-phonon lines related to the N-V centers is
   demonstrated for the first time for electron-irradiated and annealed
   DND particles at continuous laser excitation. Combined Raman and PL
   analysis of DND crystallites dispersed on a Si substrate leads to the
   conclusion that the observed N-V luminescence originates from primary
   particles with sizes exceeding 30 nm. These findings demonstrate that
   by manipulation of the size/nitrogen content in DND there are prospects
   for mass production of nanodiamond photoemitters based on bright and
   stable luminescence from nitrogen-related defects.

AB Catalytic activity of the size-controlled platinum nanoparticles
   supported on the acid-pretreated gamma-alumina has been tested in
   complete methane oxidation under lean conditions. The mean sizes of
   platinum particles varied from 1.3 to 10 nm with the narrow size
   distribution (TEM data). It has been found that the reaction under
   study is strongly size sensitive. The size dependence of the specific
   catalytic activity is narrow and bell-shaped, with the maximum TOF
   value observed for the catalysts containing partially oxidized platinum
   with the mean particle sizes of about 2 nm. The observed strong size
   sensitivity is shown to originate from the size dependence of the
   apparent activation energy of the methane oxidation and/or the platinum
   oxidation state in the catalytically active nanoparticles. (C) 2009

AB The compartmentalization of size-tuned luminescent semiconductor
   nanocrystal quantum dots (QDs) in four distinctive cell lines, which
   would be representative of the most likely environmental exposure
   routes to nanoparticles in humans, is studied. The cells are fixed and
   permeabilized prior to the addition of the QDs, thus eliminating any
   cell-membrane-associated effects due to active QD uptake mechanisms or
   to specificity of signaling routes in different cell types, but leaving
   intact the putative physical subcellular barriers. All quantitative
   assays are performed using a high content analysis (HCA) platform,
   thereby obtaining robust data on large cell populations. While smaller
   QDs 2.1 nm in diameter enter the nuclei and localize to the nucleoli in
   all cell types, the rate and dynamics of their passage vary depending
   on the cell origin. As the QD size is increased to 4.4 nm, penetration
   into the cell is reduced but each cell line displays its own cutoff
   size thresholds reflecting cell-type-determined cytoplasmic and nuclear
   pore penetration specificity. These results give rise to important
   considerations regarding the differential compartmentalization and
   susceptibility of organs, tissues, and cells to nanoparticles, and may
   be of prime importance for biomedical imaging and drug-delivery
   research employing nanoparticle-based probes and systems.

AB We study the effects of chemical bonding on Raman scattering from
   benzenethiol chemisorbed on silver clusters using time-dependent
   density functional theory (TDDFT). Raman scattering cross sections are
   computed using a formalism that employs analytical derivatives of
   frequency-dependent electronic polarizabilities, which treats both
   off-resonant and resonant enhancement within the same scheme. In the
   off-resonant regime, Raman scattering into molecular vibrational modes
   is enhanced by one order of magnitude and shows pronounced dependence
   on the orientation and the local symmetry of the molecule. Additional
   strong enhancement of the order of 10(2) arises from resonant
   transitions to mixed metal-molecular electronic states. The Raman
   enhancement is analyzed using Raman excitation profiles (REPs) for the
   range of excitation energies 1.6-3.0 eV, in which isolated benzenethiol
   does not have electronic transitions. The computed vibrational
   frequency shifts and relative Raman scattering cross sections of the
   metal-molecular complexes are in good agreement with experimental data
   on surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) from benzenethiol adsorbed
   on silver surfaces. Characterization and understanding of these
   effects, associated with chemical enhancement mechanism, may be used to
   improve the detection sensitivity in molecular Raman scattering.

   polyaniline phosphotungstate. Such composite structures have mixed
   electronic and proton conductivity, high surface area and porosity.
   These materials were decorated with catalytically-active noble metals -
   Pt, Pd, and Rh. Metal nanoparticles were uniformly distributed in the
   polymer matrix. Such ternary composites can be considered as electrode
   materials in sensors, electrolysers, supercapacitors, and especially in
   low-temperature fuel cells with a proton-conducting polymer membrane.

AB Doping of nanocrystalline TiO2 powders with sizes ranging from 9.5 nm
   up to 19.1 nnn was carried out with thiourea (TU) to introduce the C, N
   and S-species into the TiO2. The crystal size was determined by X-ray
   diffraction. Doped-TiO2 particles were colored while the undoped TiO2
   was white. The edge of the absorption band edge was analyzed to
   describe the TiO2 band gap according to the indirect transitions theory
   of semiconductors. In the former analysis the energy distribution of
   the doped centers is discussed in terms of the Urbach's tail theory (K
   = K(0)exp(sigma((h nu - E-g)/kT))), being K the absorbance in the
   Kubelka-Munk equation. Evidence is presented for thiourea doped-TiO2
   leading to Urbach's tail associated with the formation of states in the
   band-gap rather than a narrowing of the band gap. The photocatalytic
   activity of the doped-TiO2 was tested by the reduction of
   tetra-nitromethane to nitroform and by the oxidation of I- to I-3(-).
   The rate of formation of nitroform (NF) produced under 460 nm light
   increased for the smaller TiO2 nanoparticles. This suggests the
   formation of localized centers under 460 nm light. But under 366 nm
   light, the highest rate of NF formation was observed for samples with
   the biggest nanocrystal size. Under 366 nm light, the smaller particles
   show a low rate of nitroform formation due to a more favorable band-gap
   electron-hole recombination. Lipid phosphatidylethanolcholine (PE)
   under 460 nm visible light in the presence of doped-TiO2 led to the
   formation of conjugated of double bonds in PE. This implies the
   formation of peroxy radicals due to the TiO2 e(cb)(-) localized
   electronic states under visible light irradiation. (C) 2009 Elsevier

AB We present the results of molecular dynamics simulations for the
   capillary imbibition of a drop of an ionic PbI2 melt into inorganic BN,
   MoS2, and carbon nanotubes. Radial atomic distribution functions are
   used to characterize the structure of the liquid inside of nanotubes
   and the kinetics of the penetration. We find that in all cases the PbI2
   melt remains liquid but a shell-like structure of the melt along the
   nanotube axis becomes visible. The filling of MoS2 nanotubes obeys the
   Lucas-Washburn equation within each shell, whereas the filling of
   carbon and BN nanotubes follows a modified expression. Both the
   chemical nature and roughness of the nanotube walls play an important
   role in the capillary kinetics and the habitus of the embedded liquid.

AB A study of "inverted" core-shell, MnO/gamma-Mn2O3, nanoparticles is
   presented. Crystal and magnetic structures and characteristic sizes
   have been determined by neutron diffraction for the antiferromagnetic
   core (MnO) and the ferrimagnetic shell (gamma-Mn2O3). Remarkably, while
   the MnO core is found to have a T-N not far from its bulk value, the
   magnetic order of the gamma-Mn2O3 shell is stable far above T-C,
   exhibiting two characteristic temperatures, at T similar to 40 K
   [T-C(gamma-Mn2O3)] and at T similar to 120 K [similar to T-N(MnO)].
   Magnetization measurements are consistent with these results. The
   stabilization of the shell moment up to T-N of the core can be
   tentatively attributed to core-shell exchange interactions, hinting at
   a possible magnetic proximity effect.

AB Hydriding or oxidation of a metal nanoparticle starts on the surface
   and results in the formation of a hydride or oxide shell. Due to
   expansion of the shell, the strain in the metal core is tensile, and in
   principle it may induce the formation of a hollow structure (this
   hollow-formation mechanism is alternative to that based on the
   Kirkendall effect). Using the theory of elasticity, we show that this
   is feasible for oxides but not feasible for hydrides.

   SnO2-Au nanocomposites with an Au/Sn ratio similar to 1 were
   synthesized by the Successive Ionic Layer Deposition (SILD) method. The
   thickness of the Au-SnO2 nanocomposites deposited on the surface of the
   SnO2 films was controlled through a change of the number of deposition
   cycles. It was established that the indicated modification promotes

AB Germanium dioxide (GeO2) crystals were prepared by precipitation from
   water solution of ammonium germanate with nitric acid at a relatively
   low-temperature (100 degrees C). The grown GeO2 crystals were
   characterized to study their microstructure and chemical analysis using
   X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM), infrared (IR) spectroscopy, and
   Raman spectroscopy techniques. The results indicate that the grown GeO2
   crystals exhibit a.-quartz type crystal structure. The lattice
   parameters obtained from XRD were a = 4.987(4) angstrom and c =
   5.652(5) angstrom. The crystals formed were submicrometer in size and
   exhibited uniform shape and diameter, which is about 500 nm. The
   characterization using microscopic and spectroscopic measurements
   indicate a high structural quality of GeO2 crystals, in terms of
   control for morphology, single-phase, and chemical bonding and local
   structure, grown using the present approach.

AB Mechanical milling and ultrasonic mechanical coating and armouring
   (UMCA) were used for depositing of TiN coatings on different
   substrates. A powder and balls were placed in a vibration chamber. The
   substrate can be placed in the chamber with the powder or it can be
   fixed to the top of the chamber. During a mechano-activation process,
   the substrate surface is subjected to high-energy ball impacts. Powder
   particles trapped between the ball and surface cold weld to the
   surface. TiN coatings can be formed in a short time at room temperature
   under ambient atmosphere. The thickness, roughness and structure were
   found to depend on substrate hardness, milling intensity and size of
   initial TiN particles. Coatings having thicknesses up to 18 mu m were
   fabricated through mechanical milling when the 7 mm balls and 50 nm
   particles were used. UMCA could be used to form smooth uniform coatings
   (thickness: similar to 5 mu m) after treatment for 6 min on 10 cm

AB High quality Cr-doped ZnO nanoparticles from the gas phase were
   prepared and investigated with respect to their structural, optical and
   magnetic properties. The extended x-ray absorption fine structure and
   the x-ray absorption near edge structure of the particles verify that
   after nanoparticle preparation Cr is incorporated as Cr3+ at least
   partially on sites with a 4-fold oxygen configuration, most likely on a
   Zn site, into the wurtzite lattice. Despite the fact that Cr is known
   to act as an efficient non-radiative loss centre for near band gap
   emission (NBE), a pronounced NBE is obtained up to room temperature
   even for a nominal Cr concentration of 10 at.%. Annealing at 1000
   degrees C results in a significant improvement of the photoluminescence
   efficiency and a reduced PL linewidth down to 2.9 meV at low
   temperatures while the structural and magnetic data indicate the
   formation of ZnCr2O4 clusters.

AB Nanocrystalline cadmium sulfide CdS thin films with relevance for
   optical applications were synthesized from aqueous solutions by
   chemical bath deposition. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction shows
   that the films formed on glass or silicon substrates are made up of
   nanocrystalline particles. About 80% of the particles have a diameter
   of 5 +/- 1 nm. The nanoparticles have either sphalerite or wurtzite
   structure. The presence of the sphalerite phase is a signature of a
   highly non-equilibrium state of the nanocrystalline film. Kinetic
   studies show that the size of the nanocrystals and the relative
   fraction of the two phases do not depend on the deposition time once it
   exceeds a duration of 30 min. For longer times, the particle
   characteristics remain constant while the thickness of the film grows.
   Thermodynamical analysis of ionic equilibria allows to choose the
   reaction bath composition for the formation of cadmium hydroxide
   Cd(OH)(2). The experiments provide strong evidence that the beginning
   of the deposition of CdS is accompanied by a formation of cadmium
   hydroxide Cd(OH)(2). (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The analytical estimates for the relaxation time of a single-domain
   particle with a nonaxially symmetric double-well potential are obtained
   in the limits of low and high dissipation regimes. The expressions
   derived turn out to be valid also for an important case of spheroidal
   nanoparticle whose easy anisotropy axis is inclined at an arbitrary
   angle to a shape anisotropy axis. The analytical estimates are compared
   with the numerical simulation results obtained for the same particle by
   means of solution of the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz equation at various
   values of the dimensionless damping parameter kappa. It is shown that
   in the case of moderate reduced energy barrier the high damping limit
   occurs at kappa >= 1.0, whereas the low damping limit corresponds to
   very small values of the damping parameter, kappa <= 0.003. For
   intermediate values of kappa, a heuristic interpolation formula for the
   particle relaxation time is suggested. It describes the numerical
   simulation results with accuracy of several percent.

AB Experimental results are presented on the formation of self-organized
   nanostructures (NSs) on a bulk Al target under its ablation in
   liquids-water and ethanol-with short laser pulses from 180 femtoseconds
   (fs) through 350 picoseconds (ps). NSs are characterized by atomic
   force microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, optical
   absorption spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction. The period of NSs does
   not depend on the laser wavelength used from 248 through 800 nm and is
   approximately 200 nm. NSs on Al show the characteristic absorption peak
   in the near UV which has been attributed to plasmon oscillation of
   electrons. The wings of this peak, extending to the visible, lead to a
   distinct yellow coloration of the processed Al surface. Ultrafast laser
   structuring of bulk aluminum in liquids may be potentially a promising
   technique for efficient production of nanosized aluminum.

AB Distribution function w(N)(T) for photons created by three-level
   nanoparticle in time interval T under cw laser excitation is calculated
   for various methods of photon counting. It is found that each
   exponential process exp(-lambda(i)t) in quantum dynamics of three-level
   nanoparticle manifests itself via Poissonian function
   P-N(lambda(i)t)=(lambda(i)t)(N) exp(-lambda(i)t)/N! in the photon
   distribution function w(N)(T). The distribution function w(N)(T) is
   expressed via two or three integrals of two or three Poissonian
   functions P-N(lambda(i)t). The simple mathematical expression for
   w(N)(T) enables one to calculate photon distribution in blinking
   fluorescence with on and off intervals. A scaling between photon
   distribution function w(N)(T) and photoelectric pulse distribution
   function w(n)(T) is found. Comparison of the theoretical distribution
   w(n)(T) and the distribution measured in blinking fluorescence of
   single polymer molecule dPPV-PPyV and complex organic molecule
   1,1(')-didodecyl-3,3,3('),3(')-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate
   (DiI) is carried out. The theoretical distributions are able to
   describe those found in an experiment.

AB A new approach to the synthesis of multifunctional nanoparticles was
   developed by using covalent anchoring of cyano-bridged coordination
   polymer Ni2+/[Fe(CN)(6)](3-) to the surface of two-photon dyedoped
   mesoporous silica nanoparticles. The obtained hybrid nanoparticles were
   studied by infrared (IR) spectroscopy, nitrogen adsorption (BET), X-ray
   diffraction, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high resolution
   transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), luminescence, and magnetic
   analysis. The synthesis leads to homogeneously dispersed uni-shaped
   nanoparticles of around 100 nm in length that are coated with
   cyano-bridged metallic coordination polymer nanoparticles. These hybrid
   nanoparticles combine effective two-photon excited fluorescence,
   porosity, high transverse nuclear relaxivity values (i.e. the magnetic
   resonance imaging efficiency) and superparamagnetic properties.

AB Conditions of polyaniline (PANI) nanotubes preparation were analyzed.
   Aniline was oxidized with ammonium peroxydisulfate in 0.4 M acetic
   acid. There are two subsequent oxidation steps and the products were
   collected after each of them. At pH > 3, neutral aniline molecules are
   oxidized to non-conducting aniline oligomers. These produce templates
   for the subsequent growth of PANI nanotubes, which takes place
   preferably at pH 2-3. At pH < 2, granular morphology of the conducting
   PANI is obtained. High final acidity of the medium should be avoided in
   the preparation of nanotubes, e.g., by reducing the amount of sulfuric
   acid which is a by-product. Reduction of the peroxydisulfate-to-aniline
   mole ratio was tested for this purpose in the present study. Lowering
   of the reaction temperature from 20A degrees C to -4A degrees C had a
   positive effect on the formation of nanotubes.

AB Nanooctahedra of MoS2 are considered to be the true inorganic
   fullerenes, exhibiting different properties from the bulk and also
   other closed-cage morphologies of the same material. These structures
   are produced in high energy systems where the synthesis is performed
   far from equilibrium conditions, and the reaction mechanism involved
   remains unknown. Here, the discovery of two imperfect structures of
   nanooctahedra-the distorted octahedra and seashell structures with
   meander-like cross sections-is reported and studied in detail using
   transmission electron microscopy and quantum-mechanical methods. These
   nanoparticles can serve to understand the synthesis route by
   establishing the basic principles of their morphology and stability.
   The fundamental properties of the inorganic lattice are the basis for
   matching the projections observed in microscopy images with a suggested
   atomistic model, Quantum-mechanical calculations are used to estimate
   their stability and electronic properties. It was concluded that the
   production of nanooctahedra involves a high temperature stage, where
   lattice defects enable the formation of a closed structure Without a
   templating particle. Thereafter at lower temperatures, the mixture of
   products is carried forward and the annealing contributes to the

AB The preparation and characterization (XRD, N-2 adsorption, TEM, EDX,
   DRS-UV) of a novel catalytic material Ti-SMCMS (solid magnetic
   core-mesoporous shell) is reported. The material has quasi spherical
   particles with an ordered mesoporous silicate shell containing isolated
   Ti atoms and a silica core which, in turn, comprises superparamagnetic
   iron oxide nanoparticles. The magnetic kernels are embedded in the
   nonporous silica core and, thus, are completely protected from ambient
   medium. The material was found to combine the advantages of high
   activity and selectivity in H2O2-based selective oxidations with the
   merits of an easy magnetic separation from the reaction mixture.

AB Dynamic core-shell-shell-corona micelles are formed between two
   oppositely charged block copolymer systems. Preformed
   polybutadiene-block-poly(N-methyl-2-vinylpyridinium)-block-poly(methacry
   lic acid) (PB-P2VPq-PMAA) block terpolymer micelles with a soft
   polybutadiene core, an interpolyelectrolyte complex (IPEC) shell made
   out of poly(N-methyl-2-vinylpyridinium) and poly(methacrylic acid), and
   a negatively charged PMAA corona were mixed in different ratios at high
   pH with positively charged
   poly(N-methyl-2-vinylpyridinium)block-poly(ethylene oxide) (P2VPq-PEO)
   diblock copolymers. Under these conditions, mixing results in the
   formation of a second IPEC shell onto the PB-P2VPq-PMAA precursor
   micelles, surrounded by a FED corona. The resulting multicompartmented
   IPECs exhibit dynamic behavior, highlighted by a structural relaxation
   within a period of 10 days, investigated by dynamic light scattering
   (DLS), cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), and
   scanning force microscopy (SFM). After a short mixing time of 1 h, the
   IPECs exhibit a star-shaped structure, whereas after 10 days, spherical
   core-shell-shell-corona objects could be observed. To further increase
   complexity and versatility of the presented systems, the in situ
   formation of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) in both the precursor micelles
   and the equilibrated IPEC was tested. For the PB-P2VPq-PMAA micelles,
   NP formation resulted in narrowly distributed Au NPs located within the
   PMAA shell, whereas for the core-shell-shell-corona IPEC, the Au NPs
   were confined within the IPEC shell and shielded from the outside
   through the PEO corona.

AB The bacterial action of gentamicin and that of a mixture of gentamicin
   and 15-nm colloidal-gold particles on Escherichia coli K12 was examined
   by the agar-well-diffusion method, enumeration of colony-forming units,
   and turbidimetry. Addition of gentamicin to colloidal gold changed the
   gold color and extinction spectrum. Within the experimental errors,
   there were no significant differences in antibacterial activity between
   pure gentamicin and its mixture with gold nanoparticles (NPs). Atomic
   absorption spectroscopy showed that upon application of the
   gentamicin-particle mixture, there were no gold NPs in the zone of
   bacterial-growth suppression in agar. Yet, free NPs diffused into the
   agar. These facts are in conflict with the earlier findings indicating
   an enhancement of the bacterial activity of similar gentamicin-gold
   nanoparticle mixtures. The possible causes for these discrepancies are
   discussed, and the suggestion is made that a necessary condition for
   enhancement of antibacterial activity is the preparation of stable
   conjugates of NPs coated with the antibiotic molecules.

   n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate in aqueous-organic media in the presence of a
   drug. The particles were stabilized by dextran 70,000 and poloxamer 188
   or by
   1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene
   glycol)-5000] sodium salt. It was shown that in the presence of
   dichloromethane, methanol or ethanol the encapsulation efficiency of
   loperamide in the nanoparticles reached 80%. Loading of paclitaxel was
   efficient only in the presence of the lipid. The organic solvents did
   not significantly influence the nanoparticle morphology or their
   physicochemical parameters. Thus produced poly(butyl cyanoacrylate)
   nanoparticles enabled delivery of loperamide across the blood-brain
   barrier, which was evidenced by the drug analgesic effect evaluated by
   the tail-flick test.

   lengths (lauric, myristic, palmitic and stearic acids) is studied by
   means of magnetization analysis and small-angle neutron scattering. It

   nanoparticles are dispersed in the carrier approximately with the same

   compared to the classical stabilization with non-saturated oleic acid.
   The found thickness of the surfactant shell around magnetite is

ID CHEMICAL-VAPOR-DEPOSITION; GROWTH; TETRAHYDRATE
AB Calcium tartrate doped with Ni and/or Co has been used as a catalyst
   source in the chemical vapor deposition synthesis of carbon nanotubes
   (CNTs). Thermolysis of doped calcium tartrate in an inert atmosphere
   was shown to yield Ni, Co or Ni-Co nanoparticles similar to 6 nm in
   diameter dispersed in a calcium oxide matrix. The CNT synthesis was
   carried out by ethanol vapor decomposition at 800 degrees C. The
   structure of the products was characterized by transmission electron
   microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. It was found that Ni nanoparticles
   embedded in CaO provide the narrowest diameter distribution of CNTs,
   while the bimetallic Ni-Co catalyst allows the formation of the
   thinnest CNTs with the outer diameter of similar to 2 nm. This type of
   CNT is more likely to be responsible for the lowest value of the
   turn-on field (similar to 1.8 V/mu m) for the emission current detected
   for the latter sample. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work aimed to analyze the possibility and performance of the
   temperature controlled hyperthermia based on AC heating of magnetic
   nanoparticles with low Curie temperature. Temperature dependence of
   dynamic magnetic susceptibility has been studied experimentally on fine
   powders of La0.8Ag0.15MnO2.95 in the frequency range of 0.5-2.0 MHz.
   Critical drop of the AC magnetic losses was found in the vicinity of
   the Curie point, TC = 42C. The obtained data was used in the numerical
   analysis of the bioheat equations under typical conditions of the
   hyperthermia treatment. The mathematical model includes a spherical
   tumor containing magnetic particles and surrounded by concentric
   healthy tissue, with account made for the blood perfusion. The
   calculations performed for various AC power, tumor sizes and doping
   geometries predict effective autostabilization of the temperature at T
   TC inside the tumor and steep temperature profile at the interface with
   the healthy tissue.

AB Methods of non-invasive in vivo quantification of magnetic
   nanoparticles (MP) have been proposed and realized. The methods are
   based on non-linear MP magnetization at two frequencies and measuring
   the response at combinatorial frequencies. The first method is
   developed for real-time study of MP dynamics and their clearance from
   the blood system of animals. High sensitivity of 3 ng of Fe3O4 in 0.1
   ml was achieved for MP detection in mice tail veins. The second
   technique is proposed for MP detection inside animal tissues by an
   external probe. The proposed methods could essentially widen
   capabilities of biomedical research which involves magnetic
   nanoparticles. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

ID ROUGH SURFACES; FABRICATION; PROGRESS
AB The analysis demonstrating the abilities of various types of ordered
   textures, constructed from spherical particles, to provide high water
   contact angles on the surface of the hydrophobic material is presented.
   For several ordered three-dimensional surface structures we have
   derived the equations, relating the contact angles, formed by water
   droplets on a textured coating, with the geometric parameters of the
   texture and the chemical properties of the coating. The conditions
   providing the thermodynamic stability of heterogeneous wetting regime
   on textured surfaces have been discussed. It was demonstrated that
   multimodal surface roughness facilitates essentially the attainment of
   the superhydrophobic state and the surface textures exhibiting the
   stable superhydrophobic properties may be effectively manufactured by
   controlled aggregation of particles. Based on the analysis of forces
   acting between the nanoparticles both in the bulk dispersions and in
   the deposited film, we discuss the correlation of the properties of
   dispersion with the Surface textures formed.

AB Interfacial interactions/dynamics were studied in silica
   core-poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) shell nanoparticles with the shell
   thickness of 1-2 (monolayer), 2-5, 5-15, and 8-25 nm using far- and
   mid-IR spectroscopy and DSC activation analysis of the glass
   transition. Particles were prepared using a pseudo-liquid state
   procedure. Their geometry, structural organization and shell uniformity
   were characterized comprehensively by LTNA, AFM, QELS, FT-IR and
   densitometry techniques. As revealed, strong core-shell interfacial
   interactions, including hydrogen bonding and Lewis acid-base ones,
   resulted in the quite different, multi-modal glass transition dynamics
   in PVP nano shells. For 1-2 nm thick monomolecular PVP shell, only
   several "abnormal" modes, including constrained cooperative and
   non-cooperative as well as ultra-fast non-cooperative ones, constituted
   segmental dynamics in the glass transition; the latter covered the
   range from 70 to 230 degrees C, with varying apparent activation energy
   by one order of magnitude. Ultra-fast dynamic mode was caused by
   collapse of motional cooperativity (alpha- to beta-relaxation
   transformation). (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   average diameter from 1.8 to 8 nm at 30 degrees C. The isotherms are

   intermediate pressures there is hysteresis related to the hydride
   formation and decomposition. The hysteresis shrinks with decreasing

AB Previously reported results on nanoparticle distribution control on

   Braun, D.; Susha, A. S.; Rogach, A. L.; Sukhorukov, G. B. J. Phys.
   Chem. C 2007, 111, 555). In sharp contrast to the earlier presented
   method, nonaggregated distributions of nanoparticles are obtained here
   by admixing them directly with polyelectrolyte multilayers;
   preaggregation of nanoparticles is used for aggregated distributions.
   Furthermore, control over the distribution of nanoparticles at low
   concentration is extended here for the case of the synthesis of silver
   nanoparticles or their reduction in a solution by the so-called "silver
   mirror" or Tollens reaction directly on polyelectrolyte multilayer
   capsules. In this case, temperature and time are found to control the
   size and the concentration of nanoparticles. Controlling size and
   distribution of nanoparticles on polyelectrolyte multilayer capsules is
   relevant for intracellular delivery and release.

AB Polymeric micelles with cross-linked ionic cores of poly(methacrylic
   acid) and nonionic shell of poly(ethylene oxide) (cl-micelles) are
   shown here to readily internalize in epithelial cancer cells but not in
   normal epithelial cells that form tight junctions (TJ). The
   internalization of such cl-micelles in the cancer cells proceeded
   mainly through caveolae-mediated endocytosis. In confluent normal
   epithelial cells this endocytosis route was absent at the apical side
   and the cl-micelles sequestered in TJ regions of the cell membrane
   without entering the cells for at least 24 h. Disruption of the TJ by
   calcium deprivation resulted in redistribution of cl-micelles inside
   the cells. In cancer cells following initial cellular entry the
   cl-micelles bypassed the early endosomes and reached the lysosomes
   within 30 min. This allowed designing cl-micelles with cytotoxic drug,
   doxorubicin, linked via pH-sensitive hydrazone bonds, which were
   cleaved in the acidic environment of lysosomes resulting in
   accumulation of the drug in the nucleus after 5 h. Such pH-sensitive
   cl-micelles displayed selective toxicity to cancer cells but were
   non-toxic normal epithelial cells. In conclusion, we describe major
   difference in interactions of cl-micelles with cancer and normal cells
   that can lead to development of novel drug delivery system with reduced
   side effects and higher efficacy in cancer chemotherapy. Published by

AB Relaxation dynamics of silver nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in glass
   have been studied by picosecond time-resolved transient grating (TG)
   spectroscopy. Phosphate-based glasses were prepared by melting and
   heat-treatment processes by which two different nanometal-glass
   composites were produced. The first is a glass system containing silver
   and tin in which Ag NPs are embedded in the matrix upon heat treatment.
   The second is a heat-treated silver-doped glass with spectroscopic
   indications of Ag+-Ag-0 pairs located at or near the surface of the
   NPs. The time evolution of the light-induced TG for the Ag/Sn-doped
   glass shows an uncommon relaxation on the nanosecond time scale. Such
   behavior is explained in terms of energy transfer processes between
   polaronic and/or excitonic states in the near-interface region of the
   glass matrix and the NPs. In contrast, a faster monotonic relaxation is
   observed for the Ag-doped nanocomposite. This result is attributed to
   Ag NP -> Ag+-Ag-0 plasmon resonance energy transfer.

AB Size-dependent effects in nanostructured (nanocrystalline, nanophase or
   nanocomposite) materials are of great importance both for fundamental
   considerations and modern technology. The effect of the
   nanoparticle/nanocrystallite size on surface energy, melting point,
   phase transformations, and phase equilibriums is considered as applied
   to nanostructured materials. The role of size-dependent effects in
   phonon, electronic, superconducting, magnetic, and partly mechanical
   properties is also analyzed in detail. Special attention is paid to the
   contribution of other factors such as the grain boundary segregations,
   interface structure, residual stresses and pores, non-uniform
   distribution of grain sizes, and so on. The little explored and
   unresolved problems are pointed and discussed.

AB Subsurface carbon species of Pd catalysts recently attracted
   considerable attention because they affect the selectivity of
   hydrogenation reactions. We calculated the migration of C atoms from
   the Pd(111) surface to interstitial subsurface sites to be
   energetically favorable. Yet, thermodynamically more stable is a
   graphene-like phase on the Pd surface. Applying a density functional
   method on periodic models, we explored the formation of C-n (n = 2-4)
   clusters on Pd(111). At low coverage, carbon monomers on the surface
   and at octahedral subsurface sites were calculated to be more stable
   than dimer species, C-2, on the surface. However, at a C coverage of
   about half a monolayer, the formation of C-2 and C-3 species,
   precursors of a graphene phase, becomes competitive with migration of C
   monomers to octahedral subsurface sites. While discussing these
   findings, we also addressed the problem of C-1 formation on Pd
   catalysts from simple organics.

AB The explosive progress in nanoscience has led to uncovering and
   exploring numerous physical phenomena occurring at nanoscale,
   especially when metal nanostructures are involved so that optical
   fields and electronic oscillations call be resonantly coupled. The
   latter is the subject of (nano) plasmonics with implications extending
   from subwavelength waveguiding to localized field enhancements. In this
   review paper, we consider making use of various phenomena related to
   multiple scattering Of surface plasmons (SPs) at periodically and
   randomly (nano) 1 structured metal surfaces. After reviewing the SP
   waveguiding along channels in nanostructured areas exhibiting band-gap
   and localization effects, SP-driven field enhancement in random
   structures and plasmonic fractal drums is discussed in detail. SP
   manipulation and waveguiding using periodic nanostructures on the
   long-wavelength side of the band gap is also considered.

AB In this work, we proceed with the concept of developing nanoclusters
   (fundamental configurations), which are the basic building blocks of
   certain crystal structures, allowed us to propose a universal algorithm
   for crystal self-assembly structure, and hence to elaborate a uniform
   approach to the analysis of the essentially hierarchic structure of
   natural objects under the nanoscale. It should be noted that we use the
   conception, where the configuration of points on the single sphere that
   minimize potential energy for broad class of potential functions (with
   the characteristic quadric function of potential versus distance
   between points) has been studied. The model is not connected both with
   the undefined isolated from structure nets (like diamond net) and
   polyhedra (like Friauf polyhedra), which are the basis of clusters, but
   is hierarchically constructed on local polyhedral structure's searching
   according to universal algorithm. Crystal structure can explicitly
   store the information on the structure of the particles that formed it.
   These particles, geometrically distorted in some extent, can remain in
   parts of fundamental nanoclusters, coherently grow into them, and
   emerge as clusters-centaurs.

AB We studied the electrochemical properties of gold nanoparticles (GNPs)
   and their complexes with proteins using square-wave voltammetry. Effect
   of the nanoparticle size and detection procedure was explored upon the
   oxidation of GNPs on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE). For
   pre-characterized GNPs of 13, 35 and 78 nm diameter, the oxidation peak
   potential was +0.98, +1.03 and +1.06 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively. The
   conjugation of GNPs with four different proteins was verified by UV-Vis
   spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy indicated the formation of
   protein shells around GNPs. This process hampered the oxidation of GNPs
   on bare GCE causing pronounced decrease in the current response by an
   average factor of 72. GCE modification with carbon nanotubes weakly
   influenced the sensitivity of GNP detection but resulted in a 14.5-fold
   signal increase averaged for all GNP-protein complexes. The acidic
   dissolution and electrodeposition of GNPs or their complexes adsorbed
   on GCE allowed superior signal amplification directly proportional to
   nanoparticle size. The results are useful for the optimization of
   voltammetric analysis of GNP-protein complexes and can be extended to
   the characterization of other metal nanostructures and their complexes
   with biological components. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The influence of the SnO2 surface modification by the SnO2-Au
   nanocomposites on conductivity response to such reducing gases as CO
   and H-2 has been analyzed in the present paper. Both initial SnO2
   films, subjected for surface modification, and SnO2-Au nanocomposites
   were deposited by Successive Ionic Layer Deposition (SILD) method. The
   SnO2-Au nanocomposites with Au/Sn ratio similar to 1 were synthesized
   using HAuCl4 and SnCl2 precursors. The thickness of the Au-SnO2
   nanolayers varied from 0.7-1.0 nm to 10-15 nm. It was established that
   the increase in the thickness of the SnO2-Au nanocomposite layer formed
   on the surface of the SnO2 films was accompanied by both the
   improvement of sensor response and the decrease in response and
   recovery times. An explanation of the observed effects has been

AB Using the transient hot wire and pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic
   resonance methods we determined the thermal conductivity and the
   solvent self-diffusion coefficient (SDC) in aqueous suspensions of
   quasi-monodisperse spherical silica nanoparticles. The thermal
   conductivity was found to increase at higher volume fraction of
   nanoparticles in accordance with the effective medium theory albeit
   with a smaller slope. On the other hand, the SDC was found to decrease
   with nanoparticle volume fraction faster than predicted by the
   effective medium theory. These deviations can be explained by the
   presence of an interfacial heat-transfer resistance and water retention
   by the nanoparticles, respectively. We found no evidence for anomalous
   enhancement in the transport properties of nanofluids reported earlier
   by other groups.

AB Carbon nanoscrolls with a unique polygonal cross-section have been
   discovered in films synthesized by chemical vapor deposition in a
   hydrogen-methane gas mixture activated by a direct current discharge.
   The structure type has been revealed by high resolution transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM) combined with selected area electron
   diffraction patterning. The peculiarities observed in the TEM
   diffraction contrast have allowed for the identification of the
   nanoscroll shape as a twisted polygon. A three-dimensional atomic
   structure model of these complex nanocarbon species is based on a
   tilting series and the electron diffraction patterns. The proposed
   model adequately describes the structure of the nanoscrolls and the
   formation mechanism of the characteristic diffraction contrast in their
   corresponding electron microscopy images. The results point to the
   specific features of the electronic properties of nanoscrolls. (C) 2009

   INTERFACIAL DEFECTS; CONTINUUM THEORY
AB Disclinations together with dislocations represent a class of linear
   defects in solids. Disclinations are characterized by typical
   singularities and the property of multi-value of the fields of
   displacement and rotation associated with the defects. We present an
   introduction to and overview of recent achievements of the disclination
   approach in physics and mechanics of solid structures. In the
   development of F.R.N. Nabarro ideas, the use of the disclination
   approach in materials science is demonstrated. The following milestones
   of the disclination concept are given and discussed: (i) definitions
   and designations for Volterra dislocations, Frank (rotation) vector of
   a disclination, wedge and twist disclinations; (ii) geometry of
   disclinations in structure-less and crystalline solids; (iii) the
   properties of screened low-energy disclination configurations, e.g.
   loops, dipoles, defects at the vicinity of a free surface, including
   the methods and results of calculation of their elastic fields and
   energies. Then using the properties of screened disclinations a number
   of qualitative and quantitative models for the structure formation and
   evolution in plastically deformed materials, is considered.
   Disclination theory of grain boundaries and their junctions in
   conventional polycrystals is presented. The bands with misorientated
   crystal lattice in metals and other materials are described as a result
   of partial wedge disclination dipole motion. Disclination approach is
   applied to the study of work-hardening at large strains. For
   nanocrystals, disclination approach allows to explain the peculiarities
   of the flow stress dependence on the grain size. The contribution of
   disclinations to relaxation of mechanical stresses in lattice
   mismatched thin layers placed on the bulk substrate is examined and
   linked to the appearance of domain patterns. Finally, disclination
   models for the structure and properties of nanoparticles are presented.
   These models treat the pentagonal symmetry of micro- and nanoparticles
   and nanorods of materials with FCC crystal structure and explain
   stability and relaxation phenomena in such pentagonal objects. (C) 2009

AB We report on magnetic-field dependences of Hall coefficient and
   resistivity for InN films grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam
   epitaxy. The Hall coefficient rises with the magnetic field. This
   anomalous behavior is discussed in terms of the presence of highly
   conducting inhomogeneities in the films. According to the magnetic
   field and temperature dependences of the film resistivity, the
   inhomogeneities are attributed to metallic indium nanoparticles formed
   presumably around extended defects within the InN epilayers, at their
   surface and the InN/GaN interface. Good correlation is observed between
   the growth conditions of the InN films and their electrical properties
   recalculated using the model. (C) 2009 American Institute of Physics.

AB Palladium catalysts supported on nanosized CeO2 supports were
   synthesized by different methods. The catalysts showed high
   low-temperature activity (LTA) in CO oxidation. The synthesized
   palladium-ceria catalysts for low-temperature CO oxidation were
   investigated by a complex of physicochemical methods, and their
   catalytic performance was determined in the light-off regime. It was
   shown using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)
   and EDX microanalysis that the catalysts with high LTA are
   characterized by exceptionally high dispersity of palladium on the
   surface of the supports. Two different states of palladium were
   observed by XPS. They correspond to the surface interaction phases
   (SIPs) as PdxCeO2-delta and small metal clusters (<10 angstrom).
   According to diffraction images obtained by HRTEM, the latter have
   flattened shape due to epitaxial binding between (111) facets of
   palladium and CeO2. Two types of CO adsorption sites (Pd2+ and Pd-0)
   were distinguished by FTIR. They can be attributed to SIP (Pd2+) and
   palladium in flat metal clusters (Pd delta+ and Pd-0). The drop of LTA
   in CO oxidation is related to the loss of the palladium chemical
   interaction with the surface of the support and palladium sintering to
   form PdO nanoparticles. The formation of PdO particles is stimulated by
   crystallization of CeO2 particle surface due to the calcination of
   support at temperatures above 600 degrees C. The XPS, HRTEM and FTIR
   data give reliable evidence that PdO particles are not responsible for
   LTA in CO oxidation.
   In this work, the structure of the active sites consisting of two
   phases: atomically dispersed palladium within the SIP and palladium
   metal nanoclusters is proposed. The catalyst pretreatment in hydrogen
   was found to improve significantly its catalytic (LTA) properties. The
   effect of the hydrogen pretreatment was supposed to be related to the
   formation of hydroxyl groups and their effect on the electronic and
   geometrical state of the surface active sites and their possible direct
   participation in CO oxidation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB The preparation of Pt-zeolite catalysts, including choice of the noble
   metal precursor and loading (1.0-1.8 wt.%), was optimized for
   maximizing the catalytic activity in thiophene hydrodesulphurization
   (HDS) and benzene hydrogenation (HYD). According to data obtained by
   HRTEM, XPS, EXAFS and FTIR spectroscopy of adsorbed CO, the catalysts
   contained finely dispersed Pt nanoparticles (2-5 nm) located on
   montmorillonite and zeolite surfaces as: Pt-0 (main, v(CO)=2070-2095
   cm(-1)), Pt delta+ (v(CO) = 2128 cm(-1)) and Pt2+ (v(CO) = 2149-2155
   cm(-1)). It was shown that the state of Pt depended on the Si/Al
   zeolite ratio, montmorillonite presence and Pt precursor. The use of
   H2PtCl6 as the precursor (impregnation) promoted stabilization of an
   oxidized Pt state, most likely Pt(OH)(x)Cl-y. When Pt(NH3)(4)Cl-2
   (ion-exchange) was used, the Pt-0 and hydroxo- or oxy-complexes
   Pt(OH)(6)(2-) or PtO2 were formed. The addition of the
   Ca-montmorillonite favoured stabilization of Pt+delta. The Cl- ions
   inhibit reduction of oxidized Pt state to Pt particles. The Pt-zeolite
   catalyst demonstrated high efficiency in ultra-deep desulphurization of
   DLCO. The good catalyst performance in hydrogenation activity and
   sulphur resistance can be explained by the favourable pore space
   architecture and the location and the state of the Pt clusters. The
   bimodal texture of tile developed zeolite substrates allows realizing a
   concept for design of sulphur-resistant noble metal hydrotreating
   catalyst proposed by Song [C. Song, Shape-Selective Catalysis,

AB A high concentration (1.5 x 10(6) cm(-3)) TiO2 aerosol of the average
   particle size 0.5 mu m was generated by a sonic method inside 0.1 m(3)
   Plexiglas chamber and applied for the adsorptive and
   adsorptive-photocatalytic Purification of air from vapors of acetone
   and chemical agents' model dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP). The
   adsorptive capture of acetone over the TiO2 aerosol results in
   establishing equilibrium adsorption state and is limited by the rate of
   the aerosol admission into the chamber. A model derived from the
   Langmuir isotherm describes well the acetone concentration vs. aerosol
   mass Curve and allows obtaining the adsorption constant and monolayer
   coverage of acetone in a 10 min experiment. The UV irradiation of TiO2
   aerosol accelerates dramatically the purification from acetone at the
   high relative humidity (RH)of the air. Increased RH of air decreases
   the rate of the acetone adsorption but has a little positive effect on
   the rate of photocatalytic oxidation of acetone over aerosol particles.
   The DMMP adsorption over TiO2 aerosol is accompanied by the immediate
   (tau < 10 s) and irreversible hydrolysis of DMMP with the formation of
   gas phase methanol and adsorbed methyl methylphosphonic acid. The
   irreversible reactive adsorption results in the very fast air
   purification (tau = 20-40 s)due to very small diffusion distances of
   substrate to the TiO2 surface in aerosol. The increase of the air RH
   from 4 to 37% (296 K) decreases the rate of adsorption but accelerates
   significantly the rate of photocatalytic oxidation. The complete air
   purification from organic Compounds within 10 min is possible only with
   the photocatalytic oxidation because the adsorption alone does not
   remove methanol. The time needed for the air purification over the
   nanosized TiO2 aerosol is directly determined by the rate of the
   aerosol generation which allows a further optimization of the TiO2
   aerosol air purification. The obtained results approve experimentally a
   suggestion that the photocatalytic oxidation over solid atmospheric
   aerosols actually takes part in the Earth atmosphere and serves as an
   important sink for airborne organics. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB An improvement in velocity resolution of Mossbauer spectroscopy leads
   to high quality measurement with decreasing in experimental errors for
   hyperfine parameters and more reliable fitting of complicated spectra.
   Therefore, Mossbauer spectroscopy with high velocity resolution
   demonstrated new possibilities in biomedical research. Review of the
   first studies of iron-containing proteins and various pharmaceuticals
   measured in 4096 channels and presented in 4096, 2048 and 1024 channels
   clearly showed advantages of improved Mossbauer spectroscopy in
   biomedical research in comparison with studies using low velocity
   resolution spectroscopy (512 and 256 channels). (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

DE dynamic nuclear polarisation; ENDOR; II-VI semiconductors;

   resonance; phonons; wide band gap semiconductors; zinc compounds
AB Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) effects are observed of Zn-67
   (I=5/2) nuclear spins in ZnO nanoparticles and of H-1 (I=1/2) spins of
   the Zn(OH)(2) capping layer. The almost complete polarization of these
   nuclear spins is achieved by saturating the electron paramagnetic
   resonance transition of the shallow interstitial Li donor present in
   the ZnO nanoparticles. The remarkable aspect is that this DNP is caused
   by an Overhauser mechanism although the phonons mediating the
   polarization process do not fit into the nanoparticles. An explanation
   of this DNP process is presented, and it is shown that this allows for
   a measurement of the distribution of phonon modes in the nanoparticles.
   The enhancement of the nuclear polarization also opens the possibility
   to study semiconductor nanostructures with NMR techniques.

AB Hydriding or dehydriding of metal nanoparticles is accompanied by the
   lattice strain. Using an exactly solvable model describing the strain
   distribution, we show the effect of strain on the dehydriding kinetics
   controlled by hydrogen desorption from the surface layer. The strain is
   found to suppress the desorption rate primarily during the initial
   stage of the kinetics, and this stage may be relatively slow. The
   corresponding nonlinear kinetic features are observed in experiments.

   Detailed structural analysis and the splitting of energy levels in

   cardiac myoglobin-complementary antimyoglobin antibody couple was
   taken. In the first method AuNP worked as an electrochemical sensing
   platform: the oxidation of the gold surface (resulted in gold oxide
   formation) upon polarization served as a basis for analytical response.
   In the second assay, AuNP served as effective electrocatalysts of
   Fe3+/Fe2+ electrode reaction of myoglobin. For both assays the same
   AuNP synthesis and electrodes modification procedures were used.

AB We present the first example of water soluble complexes of carotenoids.
   The stability and reactivity of carotenoids in the complexes with
   natural polysaccharide arabinogalactan were investigated by different
   physicochemical techniques: optical absorption, HPLC, and pulsed EPR
   spectroscopy. Compared to pure carotenoids, polysaccharide complexes of
   carotenoids showed enhanced photostability by a factor of 10 in water
   solutions. A significant decrease by a factor of 20 in the reactivity
   toward metal ions (Fe3+) and reactive oxygen species in solution was
   detected. On the other hand, the yield and stability of carotenoid
   radical cations photoproduced on titanium dioxide (TiO2) were greatly
   increased. EPR measurements demonstrated efficient charge separation on
   complex-modified TiO2 nanoparticles (7 nm). Canthaxanthin radical
   cations are stable for similar to 10 days at room temperature in this
   system. The results are important for a variety of carotenoid
   applications, in the design of artificial light-harvesting, photoredox,
   and catalytic devices.

AB Using the method of gas-phase synthesis, nanocrystalline powders on the
   basis of iron oxides (defect magnetite Fe3O4), with an average size of
   16, 21, 30, and 44 nm, and nanocomposites on the basis of iron and
   cobalt encapsulated into carbon, with an average size less than 10 nm
   have been prepared. The nanoparticles placed into a buffer solution
   were subjected to the action of an ac (rotating and axial) magnetic
   field. The rotating field ensures higher values of heat release as
   compared to the axial field in media with a comparatively low
   viscosity. The greatest values of heat liberation in the axial field at
   frequencies to 100 kHz are observed for the iron-oxide particles with
   an average size on the order of 16 nm (up to 20 W/g). For the
   nano-composite on the basis of Fe@C and Co@C, the specific heat losses
   in rotating fields are greater than for the axial field (10 and 26 W/g,
   respectively).

AB Contrast variation in small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) experiments
   is used to compare the structures of a water-based ferrofluid, where
   magnetite nanoparticles are stabilized by sodium oleate, and its
   mixture with biocompatible polyethylene glycol, PEG. The basic
   functions approach is applied, which takes into account the effects of
   polydispersity and magnetic scattering. Different types of stable
   aggregates of colloidal particles are revealed in both fluids. The
   addition of PEG results in a reorganization of the structure of the
   aggregates: the initial comparatively small and compact aggregates
   (about 40 nm in size) are replaced by large (more than 120 nm in size)
   fractal-type structures. It is postulated that these large structures
   are composed of single magnetite particles coated with PEG, which
   replaces sodium oleate. Micelle formation involving free sodium oleate
   is observed in both fluids. The structures of the fluids remain
   unchanged with increasing temperature up to 343 K. New and specific
   possibilities of SANS contrast variation with respect to multicomponent
   systems with different aggregates are considered.

AB Nanoprecipitation represents an effective method for the production of

   nanoparticles from solutions of poly(methyl methacrylate) and its
   copolymers Since the regulation of main parameters like particle size,
   particle size distribution, and molar particle mass is very important
   for future applications, the stable nanoparticle dispersions were
   examined by scanning electron microscopy, velocity sedimentation, and
   dynamic light scattering, whereby advantages and disadvantages of each
   characterization techniques are discussed Poly-dispersities of particle
   size distributions are determined by the ratio of d(w)/d(n), where d(w)
   and d(n) are weight- and number-aver-age diameters, respectively The
   particle characteristics strongly depend on the chemical structure of
   the polymers and the way of preparation and, therefore, vary in the
   studied cases in the range of 6 < d(w) < 680 nm, whereas the
   polydispersity index d(w)/d(n) changes in the range of 1 02 to 1 40 It
   is shown that nanoparticles in a desirable size range can be prepared

AB New materials and techniques pertaining to the synthesis of inorganic
   nanotubes have been ever increasing since the initiation of the field
   in 1992. Recently, WS2 nanotubes, which are produced now in large
   amounts, were filled with molten lead iodide salt by a capillary
   wetting process, resulting in PbI2@WS2 core-shell nanotubes. This work
   features progress in the synthesis of new core-shell nanotubes,
   including BiI3@WS2 nanotubes produced in a similar same manner. In
   addition, two new techniques for obtaining core shell nanotubes are
   presented. The first is via electron-beam irradiation, i.e., in situ
   synthesis within a transmission electron microscope. This synthesis
   results in SbI3 nanotubes, observed either in a hollow core of WS2 ones
   (SbI3@WS2 nanotubes), or atop of them (WS2@SbI3 nanotubes). The second
   technique involves a gaseous phase reaction, where the layered product
   employs WS2 nanotubes as nucleation sites. In this case, the MoS2
   layers most often cover the WS2 nanotube, resulting in WS2@MoS2 core
   shell nanotubes. Notably, superstructures of the form MoS2@WS2@MoS2 are
   occasionally obtained. Using a semi-empirical model, it is shown that
   the PbI2 nanotubes become stable within the core of MoS2 nanotubes only
   above a critical core diameter of the host (>12 nm); below this
   diameter the PbI2 crystallizes as nanowires. These model calculations
   are in agreement with the current experimental observations, providing
   further support to the growth mechanism of such core-shell nanotubes.

AB Magnetic nanoparticles of magnetite (Fe3O4) and NiCuZn-doped magnetite
   (Ni-0 35Cu0 15Zn0 5Fe2O4) were prepared by coprecipitation and by

   magnetite nanoparticles (d = 12 nm) and the NiCuZn ferrite
   nanoparticles ignited at about 250 degrees C (d = 30 nm) was estimated
   from X-ray diffraction patterns The Mossbauer spectroscopy revealed the
   existence of the paramagnetic doublet in both samples For magnetite.
   coercive force of about 400 Oe was found at 5K. Likewise, the coercive
   field of the NiCuZn-doped magnetite nanoparticles decreases with Fe2+
   substitution at low temperature (260 Oe). This behavior can be
   explained taking into account the fact that the magnetocrystalline
   anisotropy constant of Fe3O4 is higher than that of NiCuZn ferrite (C)

AB We studied the accuracy of the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) for
   simulations of absorption and scattering spectra by gold nanoparticles
   (spheres, cubes, and rods ranging in size from 10 to 100 nm). We varied
   the dipole resolution and applied two DDA formulations, employing the
   standard lattice dispersion relation (LDR) and the relatively new
   filtered coupled dipoles (FCD) approach. The DDA with moderate dipole
   resolutions is sufficiently accurate for scattering efficiencies or
   positions of spectral peaks, but very inaccurate for e.g. values of
   absorption efficiencies in the near-IR. To keep relative errors of the
   latter within 10% about 107 dipoles per sphere are required.
   Surprisingly, errors for cubes are about 10 times smaller than that for
   spheres or rods, which we explain in terms of shape errors. The FCD is
   generally more accurate and leads to up to 2 times faster computations
   than the LDR. Therefore, we recommend FCD as the DDA formulation of
   choice for gold and other metallic nanoparticles.

AB The main steps of the evolution in studies related to the design and
   investigation of the structure and properties of thermotropic LC
   polymers containing mesogenic groups are discussed. The principal
   attention is focused on the results of experiments performed at the
   Laboratory of Chemical Transformations of Polymers, Faculty of
   Chemistry, Moscow State University, which was established and guided by
   Academician N.A. Plate from 1966 to 1985 and then supervised by V. P.
   Shibaev, the author of this review. Historical evidence is presented to
   demonstrate the contribution of Russian scientists to the development
   of approaches to the synthesis and study of chiral and electro- and
   photocontrollable comb-shaped LC polymers and related composites. The
   concept of preparing multifunctional LC copolymers and LC networks
   containing mesogenic, chiral, photochromic, and functional (including
   ionophoric) groups that can undergo hydrogen bonding, form complexes
   with metal ions, and interact with nanoparticles is scrutinized.
   Specific features of the structural organization of polymer mesophases
   are covered. The data on multifunctional comb-shaped LC polymers, LC
   ionomers, and LC dendrimers are examined, and the problems concerning
   the design of light-controllable LC copolymers and polymer photochromic
   composites and networks are reviewed. Some applied aspects of using LC
   polymers are considered: specifically, approaches to creation of lasers
   based on cholesterics and photo- and electroactive media in optics and
   photonics, systems for data recording and storage, holography, display
   technology, and other fields. DOI: 10.1134/S0965545X09110029

AB Hydriding and dehydriding kinetics of nanoparticles depend on the
   particle size. Our calculations illustrate that the apparent (averaged
   over size) kinetics of an ensemble of particles can be dramatically
   different compared to those of single particles. Specifically, we
   analyze the hydriding kinetics, limited by diffusion of hydrogen atoms
   from the surface layer via the hydride shell to the metallic core, and
   the dehydriding kinetics limited by associative desorption of hydrogen
   from the surface layer. In both cases, the apparent kinetics are
   relatively slow in the later stage, their time scale for the given
   average size is much larger than that for a single particle of the same
   size, and some of the special features of the single-particle kinetics
   (e.g., the initial slowdown of dehydriding) can be partly or completely
   washed out. The scaling of the time scale of the kinetics with respect
   to the particle size, however, remains valid. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB A bioengineering method for self-assembly of multifunctional
   superstructures with in-advance programmable properties has been
   proposed. The method employs two unique proteins, barnase and barstar,
   to rapidly join the structural components together directly in water
   solutions. The properties of the superstructures can be designed on
   demand by linking different agents of various sizes and chemical
   nature, designated for specific goals. As a proof of concept,
   colloidally stable trifunctional structures have been assembled by
   binding together magnetic particles, quantum dots, and antibodies using
   barnase and barstar. The assembly has demonstrated that the bonds
   between these proteins are strong enough to hold macroscopic (5 nm-3 mu
   m) particles together. Specific interaction of such superstructures
   with cancer cells resulted in fluorescent labeling of the cells and
   their responsiveness to magnetic field. The method can be used to join
   inorganic moieties, organic particles, and single biomolecules for
   synergistic use in different applications such as biosensors,
   photonics, and nanomedicine.

AB Ferrihydrite nanoparticles (2-5 nm in size) produced by bacteria
   Klebsiella oxytoca in the course of biomineralization of iron salt
   solutions from a natural medium exhibit unique magnetic properties:
   they are characterized by both the antiferromagnetic order inherent in
   a bulk ferrihydrite and the spontaneous magnetic moment due to the
   decompensation of spins in sublattices of a nanoparticle. The magnetic
   susceptibility enhanced by the superantiferromagnetism effect and the
   magnetic moment independent of the magnetic field provide the
   possibility of magnetically controlling these natural objects. This has
   opened up the possibilities for their use in nanomedicine and
   bioengineering. The results obtained from measurements of the magnetic
   properties of the ferrihydrite produced by Klebsiella oxytoca in its
   two main crystalline modifications are reported, and the data obtained
   are analyzed theoretically. This has made it possible to determine
   numerical values of the magnetic parameters of real biomineral
   nanoparticles.

AB The occurrence of metastases is one of the main causes of death in many
   cancers and the main cause of death for breast cancer patients.
   Micrometastases of disseminated tumour cells and circulating tumour
   cells are present in more than 30% of breast cancer patients without
   any clinical or even histopatbological signs of metastasis. Low
   abundance of these cell types in clinical diagnostic material dictates
   the necessity of their enrichment prior to reliable detection. Current
   micrometastases detection techniques are based on immunocytochemical
   and molecular methods suffering from low efficiency of tumour cells
   enrichment and observer-dependent interpretation. The use of highly
   fluorescent semiconductor nanocrystals, also known as "quantum dots"
   and nanocrystal-encoded microbeads tagged with a wide panel of
   antibodies against specific turnour markers offers unique possibilities
   for ultra-sensitive micrometastases detection in patients' serum and
   tissues. The nanoparticle-based diagnostics provides an opportunity for
   highly sensitive parallel quantification of specific proteins in a
   rapid and low-cost method, thereby providing a link between the primary
   tumour and the micrometastases for early diagnosis.

   of C-1-C-6 n-alkanes increases with an increase in the Pt particle size
   from 1 to 3-4 nm. Further coarsening of the particles insignificantly
   changes the specific activity. The size effect was studied for a series
   of catalysts containing platinum nanoparticles 1 to 11 nm in diameter.
   The specific catalytic activity variation range depends on the size of
   the reacting hydrocarbon molecules. As the platinum particle size
   increases, the specific catalytic activity increases 3-4 times for the
   oxidation of CH4 and C2H6 and by a factor of 20-30 for the oxidation of
   n-C4H10 and n-C6H14.

AB A direct technique for preparation of magnetically functionalised yeast
   cells by using polyelectrolyte mediated deposition of magnetite
   nanoparticles is reported. We demonstrate that the cells preserve their
   viability after the magnetite deposition and show that the magnetic
   nanoparticles form a multilayered coating on the outer side of the
   yeast cell's wall. We applied our technique to produce magnetically
   functionalised yeast cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)
   under the control of RAD54-GFP reporter and demonstrated that their
   fluorescence emission is not influenced by the presence of
   magnetite-polyelectrolyte composite coating. We show that the
   individual cells can be successfully manipulated by an external
   magnetic field which can be used for their deposition, holding and
   subsequent removal from microfluidic devices for genotoxicity and
   cytotoxicity biosensor applications. Our technique for direct
   magnetization of cells can find many other biotech applications
   including biosensors, bioreactors and bioseparation.

AB We report on detailed study of detonation nanodiamonds (DNDs) whose
   surface has been chemically modified by copper with the aid of ion
   exchange in water DND suspension. High resolution transmission electron
   microscopy, Raman, IR, electron magnetic resonance (EMR), nuclear
   magnetic resonance (NMR), and superconducting quantum interference
   device techniques were used for the characterization of DND. Carboxyl
   groups, appearing on the surface of a nanodiamond particle during its
   synthesis and purification processes, provide an effective binding of
   divalent copper ions to the surface. The binding results from the ion
   exchange between metal cations and protons of surface carboxyl groups
   in water solutions. IR data evidence the presence of multiple C - O - C
   groups in the dried copper-modified DND product. Both EMR and C-13 NMR
   provide direct evidences of the appearance of isolated Cu2+ ions on the
   surface of the 5 nm nanodiamond particles. EMR spectra reveal
   well-pronounced hyperfine structure due to Cu-63,Cu-65 nuclear spin
   I=3/2 with the spectral pattern which is typical for mononuclear
   axially distorted Cu2+ complexes in polycrystals. Using Cu2+ ions as
   paramagnetic probes two-component model of carbon inherited
   paramagnetic centers in DND is suggested. Magnetic susceptibility for
   all samples follows the Curie-Weiss law above 30 K. The concentration
   of magnetically observable copper ions Cu2+ (spin S=1/2) localized on
   the nanodiamonds surface increases up to approximately 1.5-3.5 ions per
   nanoparticle with increasing concentration of copper acetate in
   starting solutions.

AB In this article, we represent a versatile and effective technique which
   using non-toxic chemicals to prepare stable aqueous dispersions of
   silver nanoparticles (NPs) via modified Tollens process. It was shown
   that as-prepared silver colloids consisted of finely-dispersed NPs with
   average diameter about 10 nm and a relatively narrow size distribution.
   Moreover, they could be stored very stable after several months without
   observation of aggregates or sedimentation. In comparison with previous
   works where Tollens process was being used, we for the first time
   applied UV-irradiation simultaneously with glucose reduction of silver
   salt through NPs preparation. The colloidal solutions of silver NPs
   were found to exhibit a high antibacterial activity against
   gram-negative Escherichia coli. The concentration of silver leading to
   a complete inhibition of bacteria growth was revealed as low as at 1.0
   mu g ml (1) and found much lower compared to earlier reports. These
   advantages of aqueous dispersions of silver NPs make them ideal for
   green industrial, medicinal, microbiological and other applications.

AB The performance of platinum-free palladium-cobalt catalysts in oxygen
   reduction was investigated for a direct methanol fuel cell. The
   dependence of catalytic activity on precursor nature was determined for
   two classes of precursors; namely, palladium chloride and palladium
   nitrate. The nitrate precursor exhibits much higher catalytic
   performance than the chloride precursor. X-ray absorption fine
   structure (XAFS) spectra indicate that the structure of palladium
   catalyst prepared from nitrate is much closer to Pd3Co structure that
   can explain high catalytic activity. The MEA prepared from the nitrate
   catalyst achieved the peak power density of 125 mW cm(-2), which is
   much higher than 19 mW cm(-2) measured on the cell prepared from the
   chloride catalyst. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Water-soluble cationic polypyridylphenylene dendrimers (wPPPDs) of
   different generations and various contents of pyridyl and phenylene
   moieties were synthesized. Interaction of wPPPDs with DNA resulted in
   the formation of polyelectrolyte complexes stable at physiological pH
   and ionic strength. Noticeable contribution of hydrophobic interactions
   provided by phenylene groups of the dendrimer in the complex stability
   was ascertained. Data obtained by turbidimetry and a sedimentation
   assay, as well as potential measurements, strongly implied the
   inaccessibility of positively charged pyridinium groups situated in the
   inner part of the dendrimer molecules for interaction with the rigid
   double helix. Positively and negatively charged water-soluble
   nonstoichiometric polyelectrolyte complexes were prepared and phase
   separations in their water-salt solutions were investigated, According
   to DLS measurements Supported by the sedimentation assay, the addition
   of wPPPD in DNA Solution in a wide range of the Mixture composition
   (before phase separation) led to two coexisting Populations of
   nanoparticles related to the soluble DNA/wPPPDs complex and practically
   unbound DNA. The revealed spontaneous formation of nanoparticles of the
   positively charged Soluble DNA/wPPPDs complexes stable at ionic
   strength close to the physiological one is extremely encouraging for
   the development of the wPPPD vehicle to deliver gene materials to the
   cell.

AB High spatial resolution stress mapping of Si device structures is in
   high demand throughout electronic industry. This problem can be solved
   by application of the tip-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) to Si
   structures. This work involves searching for a suitable TERS material
   for the near-UV spectral range that is favorable for Raman mapping of
   Si structures. We show both theoretically and experimentally that Al is
   a good Raman enhancer at the 363.8 nm wavelength. Taking into account
   Raman selection rules of Si and high dielectric contrast between Si and
   air, we employed an inclined Al-coated Si atomic force microscope (AFM)
   tip that is also suitable for the top-illumination geometry of the
   experiment. We succeeded in detecting of a weak TERS signal of strained
   Si. Possible ways of improvement of the Si TERS signal/noise ratio are
   discussed. An Al-particle-topped AFM tip is considered as a promising
   solution to the problem. A prototype tip was fabricated. Copyright (C)

   milling in the presence of additives results in a modification of

   chemical bonding of Ti with interstitial N, C and B atoms, are formed
   in TiH2 due to contact of TiH2 nanoparticles with the respective
   additive matrix materials. Mixed configurations around Ti atoms with
   proportional combination of local Ti-H and Ti-N, Ti-C or Ti-B bonds
   significantly decrease the thermal stability of TiH2. The effect is
   most pronounced when boron is the additive. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All

AB [Re(6)Q(8)L(6)](4-) (Q S, Se, Te) clusters can serve as promising
   "building blocks'' for the creation of new porous framworks,

   clusters have multi-anchoring sites for transition metals,
   metal-organic complexes, polymers, and multidentated metal complexes,
   they could be assembled to form various inorganic or organic-inorganic
   hybrid solids with new various spatial and chemical functions. Because
   of the controllable architectures and multi-anchoring sites of clusters
   together with their photoluminescence, rhenium cluster complexes are
   promising potential candidates as catalysts, chemical color sensors,
   magnetic materials, gas storage materials, optoelectronic, diagnostic
   agents, and gene/drug carriers. A new type of mesoscale material
   comprising [Re(6)Q(8)(CN)(6)](4-) and various divalent transition
   metals in the presence of a liquid crystal template are obtained in 3D
   cubic, 2D hexagonal, and lamellar phases. The hexahydroxo complexes

   rhenium sulfido-cyanide compound, K-8[Re12CS17(CN)(6)] with a

   rhenium metal cluster complexes at various reaction conditions remain
   to be explored.

AB UV irradiation of polymeric PMMA films containing HAuCl4 followed by
   annealing at 60-80 degrees C forms gold nanoparticles directly within
   the bulk material. The kinetics of nanoparticle formation was traced by
   extinction spectra of nanocomposite film changes vs annealing time. We
   propose that UV irradiation causes HAuCl4 dissociation and thus
   provides a polymeric matrix with atomic gold. The presence of an
   oversaturated solid solution of atomic gold in the polymeric matrix
   leads to Au nanoparticle formation during annealing. This process can
   be understood as a phase transition of the first order. In this paper
   we apply several common kinetic models of the phase transition for
   describing Au nanoparticle formation inside the solid polymer matrix.
   We compare predictions of these models with the experimental data and
   show that these models cannot describe the process. We propose that the
   stabilization effect of the matrix on the growing gold nanoparticles is
   important. The simplest model introducing some probability for the
   transition from growing nanoparticle to the non-growing, stabilized
   form is suggested. It is shown that this model satisfactorily describes
   the experimentally observed evolution of the extinction spectrum of Au
   nanoparticles forming in a polymer matrix. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All

AB We report on the results of a magnetic force microscopy investigation
   of remagnetization processes in arrays of CoPt nanodisks with diameters
   of 35 and 200 nm and a thickness of 9.8 nm fabricated by e-beam
   lithography and ion etching. The controllable magnetization reversal of
   individual CoPt nanodisks by the magnetic force microscope (MFM)
   tip-induced magnetic field was demonstrated. We observed experimentally
   two essentially different processes of tip-induced remagnetization.
   Magnetization reversal of 200 nm disks was observed when the probe
   moved across the particle while in case of 35 nm nanodisks one-touch
   remagnetization was realized. Micromagnetic modeling based on the
   Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation demonstrated that the
   tip-induced magnetization reversal occurs through the essentially
   inhomogeneous states. Computer simulations confirmed that in case of
   200 nm disks the mechanism of embryo nucleation with reversed
   magnetization and further dynamic propagation following the probe
   moving across the particle was realized. On the other hand one-touch
   remagnetization of 35 nm disks occurs through the inhomogeneous
   vortexlike state. Micromagnetic LLG simulations showed that
   magnetization reversal in an inhomogeneous MFM probe field has a lower
   energy barrier in comparison with the mechanism of coherent rotation,
   which takes place in a homogeneous external magnetic field.

AB The effective viscosity of nanosuspensions is simulated using the
   molecular dynamics method. It is found that viscosity is controlled not
   only by the volume concentration of nanoparticles, by also by their
   mass and diameter. The viscosity of even strongly rarefied
   nanosuspensions (with a low concentration of nanoparticles) cannot be
   described by the Einstein relation. This means that the mechanism
   responsible for the increase in the viscosity of the medium is not of
   hydrodynamic origin. It is shown that the formation of viscosity of
   nanosuspensions is associated to a considerable extent with
   nonequilibrium microfluctuations of density and velocity of the carrier
   medium, which are induced by the motion of nanoparticles.

AB Variations in the size distribution of CuCl particles in the glass
   formed at different temperatures are studied via the
   temperature-dependent exciton spectra (the exciton-thermal analysis).
   The kinetics of melting of CuCl nanocrystals is measured via changes in
   the strength of exciton absorption during linear heating of the sample.
   Then, using the known dependence of the melting temperature of CuCl
   nanoparticles on their size, the size distribution of the CuCl
   nanocrystals is found. During the first, second, and early third stages
   of nucleation, the width delta of the size distribution grows with an
   increase in the mean radius of the nanoparticles R (m) . During the
   first nucleation stage, when R (m) = 1.2 nm, which is just above the
   critical radius, the ratio delta/R (m) is about 0.2. While the mean
   radius of the distribution increases to 8 nm, the ratio delta/R (m)
   varies only slightly in the range 0.20-0.35. A further increase in the
   mean radius of the distribution to 16 nm is accompanied by a twofold
   increase in the delta/R (m) ratio. The shape of the distribution is
   close to Gaussian both at the initial and later stages of the growth of
   CuCl particles in glass.

AB A single-molecule detection setup based on total internal reflection
   fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy has been used to investigate association
   and dissociation kinetics of unlabeled 30mer DNA strands.
   Single-molecule sensitivity was accomplished by letting unlabeled DNA
   target strands mediate the binding of DNA-modified and fluorescently
   labeled liposomes to a DNA-modified surface. The liposomes, acting as
   signal enhancer elements, enabled the number of binding events as well
   as the residence time for high affinity binders (K-d < 1 nM, k(off) <
   0.01 s(-1)) to be collected under equilibrium conditions at low pM
   concentrations. The mismatch discrimination obtained from the residence
   time data was shown to be concentration and temperature independent in
   intervals of 1-100 pM and 23-46 degrees C, respectively. This suggests
   the method as a robust means for detection of point mutations at low
   target concentrations in, for example, single nucleotide polymorphism
   (SNP) analysis.

AB A simple kinetic approach based on approximate solution of the

   for the calculation of the hysteresis loop of a superparamagnetic
   nanoparticle assembly with predominantly uniaxial magnetic anisotropy.
   The hysteresis loops of the oriented assembly have been obtained in the
   intermediate to high damping limit as a function of temperature at
   various angles that the applied magnetic field makes with the particle
   easy anisotropy axis. An analytic approximation is given for the
   effective energy barriers separating energy wells. The evolution of the
   hysteresis loop as a function of temperature is shown to take place
   between the ultimate Stoner-Wohlfarth loop and the equilibrium
   magnetization curve. Analytical estimates for the coercive force and
   the blocking temperature are obtained both for ordered and randomly
   oriented assemblies of uniaxial particles. (C) 2009 American Institute

AB In the emission spectra of many objects, there are regions where the
   intensity distribution is similar to the blackbody spectrum. This
   allows one to determine the temperature by recording the emission
   spectrum and comparing it to a Planck spectrum. Experimental or
   calculated data on the emissivity of such objects are not necessary
   because the temperature is determined as a parameter of the
   distribution observed. This property characterizes the emission spectra
   of gaseous and solid-phase flames, erosion plasmas of surface
   discharges, metals, semiconductors, dielectrics, micro- and
   nanoparticles, and heterogeneous media (powder mixtures and ceramics)
   at temperatures both lower and higher than the melting temperature.
   Spectrometers with photodetector arrays sensitive in the wavelength
   range of 200-1100 nm are used to record spectra. Such spectrometers
   allow spectrum recording and determination of the radiator temperature
   in the temperature range of 800 K-140 kK within a time of similar to 1
   ms. The specific features of the method, examples of its application,
   measurement characteristics, unsolved problems, and prospects are
   discussed in the review.

AB Nanosizing is an advanced formulation approach to address the issues of
   poor aqueous solubility of active pharmaceutical ingredients. Here we
   present a procedure to prepare a nanoparticulate formulation with the
   objective to enhance dissolution kinetics of taxifolin dihydrate, a
   naturally occurring flavonoid with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and
   hepatoprotective activities. Polyvinylpirrolidone was selected as a
   carrier and the solid nanodispersions of varying compositions were
   prepared by a co-precipitation technique followed by lyophilization.
   The formulation technology reported herein resulted in aggregate-free,
   spherical particles with the mean size of about 150 nm, as observed by
   scanning electron microscopy and measured by photon correlation
   spectroscopy. Furthermore, the co-precipitation process caused
   taxifolin dihydrate to convert into an amorphous form as verified by
   X-ray powder diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, hot stage
   microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Finally, in vitro dissolution
   behavior of the nanodispersion of taxifolin was shown to be superior to
   that of either pure drug or a drug-polymer physical mixture, reaching
   90% of taxifolin released after 30 min. Such enhanced drug release
   kinetics from the nanodispersion was attributed to both the reduced
   particle size and the loss of crystallinity. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All

AB The results from a dynamic light scattering study of concentrated
   aqueous systems of polyethylene oxide-polypropylene oxide-polyethylene
   oxide triblock copolymer (PEO-PPO-PEO, Pluronic F108) are reported at
   pressures to 2500 bar and temperatures from 0 to 110 degrees C. The
   pressure-temperature (P-T) phase behavior for this micellar system
   exhibits several phase transformations at high concentrations including
   a transition from a liquid to a gel phase and a subsequent re-entrant
   transition from the gel phase to a liquid phase with increasing
   temperature. The gel phase region is bounded at low temperatures by a
   liquid-to-gel phase transition curve that increases in pressure with
   increasing temperature, eventually exhibits a maximum in pressure, and
   then at high temperatures rapidly decreases as the temperature is
   further increased. The high temperature branch of this curve represents
   a gel-melting transition. Aqueous F108 samples are doped with latex
   probe nanoparticles to facilitate the characterization of the local
   viscosity and also to serve as a reference for the measurement of the
   light intensity scattered by the Pluronic systems. Both the intrinsic
   collective dynamics of the Pluronic systems and the diffusive dynamics
   of the nanoparticle probes are characterized. The diffusive dynamics of
   the nanoparticle probes reveal the nonmonotonic character of viscosity
   that results from phase transformations dependent on pressure and
   temperature. The micellar system scattering intensity, obtained from
   DLS data through comparison with the light intensity scattered by the
   probe nanoparticles, increases with heating indicating critical
   pretransitional behavior of concentration fluctuations on approach to
   the cloud-point boundary over a broad temperature interval that spans
   the gel phase temperature range.

AB Two variants of the surface-nonbridging oxygen hole center,

   stabilized in porous films of silica nano-particles were investigated
   by time resolved luminescence excited in the visible and UV spectral
   range by a tunable laser system. Both defects emit a photoluminescence
   around 2.0 eV with an excitation spectrum evidencing two maxima at 2.0
   and 4.8 eV, this emission decreases by a factor similar to 2 on
   increasing the temperature from 8 up to 290 K. However, the different
   local structure influences the emission lineshape. the quantum yield
   and the decay lifetime. Such peculiarities are discussed on the basis
   of the symmetry properties of these defects. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All

   number of monomers in a cluster) in intersecting molecular and cluster
   beams sublimate from the surface of clusters after a certain time and

   clusters. Experiments have been carried out for detecting these
   molecules by means of a pyroelectric detector and the infrared
   multiphoton excitation method. The multiphoton absorption spectra of
   molecules sublimating from the surface of clusters have been obtained.
   The temperature of the (CO2) (N) nanoparticles in the cluster beam has
   been estimated using these spectra and comparing them with the infrared
   multiphoton absorption spectra of SF6 in the initial molecular beam.

AB Poly(styrene-co-N-vinylformamide) (poly(St-co-VFA)) nanoparticles with
   the diameter from 55 to 200 nm were prepared by emulsion
   copolymerization and their self-assembling was studied. In the
   dispersions of these particles, the formation of iridescent periodic
   colloid structures is observed. The period of the structures is about
   220 nm and shows no cymbate dependence on the nanoparticle size,
   indicating the possible variety of packing types occurring during the
   self-assembling of nanoparticles in dispersions. For 250-300 nm sized
   poly(styrene-co-methacrylic acid) (poly(St-co-MAA)) particles, it was
   shown that ionization of their surface carboxylic groups in alkaline
   media leads to the considerable improvement of the photonic crystal
   structures obtained from the dispersions of these nanoparticles. It was
   demonstrated that cationic chromophores can be adsorbed on their
   negatively charged surface. In this way, chromophore-modified polymer
   photonic crystal materials for applications as gas or liquid sensors
   could be prepared, as their measured fluorescence spectra show
   remarkable and reversible responses to the presence of polar organic
   solvent vapors, e.g. acetone. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Size-dependent changes were found in the Ba-137 NMR spectra of
   ensembles of very small BaTiO3 particles. The NMR line shapes were
   studied at different Larmor frequencies over a broad temperature range.
   In the tetragonal phase, the NMR lines may be decomposed into a
   contribution typical for the line shape of bulk samples ("ordered"
   part) and a part in which the tetragonal symmetry is no longer visible
   ("disordered" part). Both contributions reveal typical changes when the
   temperature is varied in the range of the tetragonal phase, i.e.,
   between approximately 400 and 300 K. The "ordered" part reveals a
   first-order phase transition at temperature T-f which decreases when
   the particle size becomes smaller. As is known, in the case of bulk
   material the quadrupole coupling constant C-Q may be related to the
   order parameter (spontaneous polarization P-S). Therefore, for all
   samples the temperature dependence of the C-Q in the "ordered" part was
   studied in the whole tetragonal phase. Its temperature dependence below
   T-f, with a jump at the first-order phase transition, can be described
   by an exponential law C-Q proportional to(T-f-T)(beta)+const for T <
   T-f, in analogy to the Landau theory, but the parameter beta is less
   than 1/2. The "disordered" part shows no jump at T-f where its
   quadrupole coupling constant is approximately zero. The data are used
   to discuss a structural model for the fine particles.

   generalized; practical applications of these solvents are considered.
   Methods for performing kinetic and physicochemical experiments,
   processing the data, constructing kinetic models, and calculating the
   thermodynamics of nonideal supercritical fluids (the parameters of
   critical points, binodal and spinodal lines, and critical point drifts;
   the thermophysical properties of reaction mixtures under supercritical
   conditions; etc.) are described. Attention is focused on the effect of
   supercritical fluid pressure on the rate constants of chemical
   reactions. The kinetics and mechanisms of the reactions of 2-propanol
   dehydration and decomposition of aliphatic nitro compounds in
   supercritical water and the isomerization of terpene compounds
   (alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, and turpentine) in supercritical lower
   alcohols are studied. The formation of nanoparticles in supercritical
   fluid solvents and the treatment of ultradisperse diamonds in
   supercritical water are considered. The results formed the basis for
   the simulation and calculation of acetic acid and phenol oxidation
   processes in supercritical water and the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis in a
   supercritical solvent and for the development of a pilot plant for the
   complete oxidation of trinitroglycerol and diethylene glycol dinitrate
   in supercritical water.

AB We report on the investigation of the electrical and optical properties
   of hybrid active layers for organic devices consisting of a conjugated
   polymer MEH-PPV mixed with ZnO and Si nanoparticles. The effect of an
   electric field on the photoluminescence (PL) from a MEH-PPV : ZnO
   composite film is studied. We have found that in the absence of an
   electric field PL emission from the MEH-PPV : ZnO composites have two
   main maxima in the blue-red regions. Three additional minor PL maxima
   attributed to the exciplex states were found at similar to 420-480 nm.
   Application of a voltage bias to planar electrodes significantly
   suppresses the blue emission. Generation of excited states in the
   MEH-PPV : ZnO structures implies the presence of several radiative
   recombination mechanisms with the formation of polymer-nanoparticle
   complexes including exciplex states and charge transfer between the
   polymer and nanoparticles that can be controlled by an electric field.
   This effect provides the possibility to tune by an electric field the
   emission colour of organic light emitting diodes by combining an
   efficient emission from both organic/inorganic materials involved.

AB The three types of defects-microcavity (linear media without resonant

   nanoparticles), and stripe (the defect with high density of resonant
   atoms)-are discussed here. The nonlinear polariton transmission,
   reflection, and trapping by defects in the resonantly absorbing Bragg
   grating (RABG) are demonstrated by numerical simulations. A geometric
   optics interpretation is proposed to estimate the solitary polaritonic
   wave velocity inside wide defects such as grooves and stripes when the
   reflection on the interface between the RABG and a defect is
   negligible. The values of solitary wave velocity calculated from
   geometric optics approximation gives a good agreement with the values
   computed numerically. It is shown that the electromagnetic field
   propagating through RABG can be captured inside the microcavity placed
   in the RABG.

AB First-order phase transitions in nanoparticles (e.g., metal hydride
   formation) occur via absorption of species from or release to the gas
   Or liquid phase. If the lattice strain is negligible, the uptake
   corresponding to a new phase exhibits a stepwise rise or drop with
   increasing or decreasing pressure or chemical potential of the absorbed
   species. With decreasing nanoparticle size, L, and increasing role of
   the surface and subsurface layers, this feature becomes less manifested
   because the system is less ideal. We present 3D lattice Monte Carlo
   simulations, explicitly illustrating this effect for L in the range
   from 100 down to 10 (L is measured in units of lattice spacing). (C)

   analyzed for particle charges of various magnitudes and signs.
   Analytical expressions are obtained for the coagulation rate constant
   between particles whose interaction in the free-molecular regime is
   described by a singular potential. It is shown that van der Waals and
   polarization forces significantly increase the coagulation rate between
   a neutral and a charged particle (by a factor of up to 10) and can even
   suppress the Coulomb repulsion between like-charged particles of widely

AB Using HRTEM, XRD and Raman spectroscopy we demonstrated a polyhedral
   multi-shell fullerene-like structure of astralen particles. The
   polyhedra consist of large defect-free flat graphitic faces connected
   by defective edge regions with presumably pentagon-like structure. The
   faces comprise a stacking of 20-50 planar graphene sheets with
   inter-sheet distance of similar to 0.340 nm. Average sizes of the
   particles and their flat faces are of similar to 40 nm and similar to
   15 nm, respectively. EPR spectra of astralen powder reveal two
   components: a very broad signal with Delta H-pp > 1 T and an asymmetric
   narrow one centered close to g=2.0. The latter consists of two
   overlapping Lorentzian lines. All spectral components are independent
   of the ambient pressure. The intensities of all EPR signals show no
   changes on decreasing temperature from T=300 K down to 4 K
   demonstrating the Pauli paramagnetism. Temperature dependent C-13 NMR
   measurements yield nuclear spin-lattice relaxation times T-1n similar
   to T-0.612. The exponent in the temperature T-1n(T)-dependence for
   astralen falls between the metallic behavior, T-1n similar to T-1
   (Korringa relation), and the semiconductor behavior, T-1n similar to
   T-0.5. The unusual magnetic resonance features are attributed to
   delocalized charge carriers which amount considerably exceeds that of
   spins localized in defects on astralen edges. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB Novel silica-coated Tb(III) nanoparticles with high luminecsence were
   synthesized using the reverse microemulsion procedure. The quenching of
   luminescent properties of these nanoparticles can be achieved by ion
   exchange and energy transfer mechanisms. The quenching through the ion
   exchange of Tb(III) by H+ or La(III) is time dependent, indicating that
   the ion exchange is probably diffusion controlled. The quenching by
   Co(III) complex cations is achieved by the energy transfer mechanism
   and thus is not time dependent. The analysis of quenching data in
   Stem-Volmer cooordinates reveal the negative charge of the
   silica-coated Tb(III)-TCAS nanoparticles and several types of
   luminophoric species, located within the core and close to the surface
   of silica nanoparticles.

AB We present comprehensive experimental and theoretical studies of
   poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) ablation by single pulses of 9.17 mu m
   laser radiation in a wide range of fluences. Ablation was carried out
   in a quartz cell through which nitrogen under atmospheric pressure was
   pumped. The composition of the ablation products was analysed with the
   use of an automatic diffusion battery. Both the irradiated surface and
   the substrate with the deposited ablation products were examined by
   transmission electron microscopy. Different aspects and stages of
   ablation have been investigated: laser heating and vaporization of the
   PMMA surface, mechanisms of ablation, dynamics of the laser-induced
   plume, nanoparticle formation in the plume and/or ejection from the
   irradiated surface. It has been found that the size distribution of
   nanoparticles formed during ablation changes its form from a single
   peak to a bimodal shape with increasing laser fluence. The
   transformation of the size distribution is analysed with the help of
   thermal and gasdynamic modelling which gives a basis for insight into
   the mechanisms and dynamics of ablation.

AB The structure and dielectric properties of sodium nitrite and its solid
   solutions confined in porous glasses have been studied. The temperature
   dependences of the order parameter and the unit cell volume for NaNO2
   embedded into porous glasses with different pore sizes were studied by
   neutron diffraction in the ferro- and paraelectric phases. The
   characteristic sizes of nanoparticles are determined. It is shown that
   at a size of nanoparticles smaller than similar to 50 nm a crossover of
   the phase transition from first order to second order is observed. The
   effect of doping of sodium nitrite with potassium nitrite on the
   dielectric properties of the nanocomposite materials was studied and a
   strong lowering of the dielectric losses was observed.

AB The vacancy defect evolution under electron irradiation in austenitic
   Fe-34.2 wt% Ni alloys containing oversized (aluminum) and undersized
   (silicon) alloying elements was investigated by positron annihilation
   spectroscopy at temperatures between 300 and 573 K. It is found that
   the accumulation of vacancy defects is considerably suppressed in the
   silicon-doped alloy. This effect is observed at all the irradiation
   temperatures. The obtained results provide evidence that the
   silicon-doped alloy forms stable low-mobility clusters involving
   several Si and interstitial atoms, which are centers of the enhanced
   recombination of migrating vacancies. The clusters of Si-interstitial
   atoms also modify the annealing of vacancy defects in the Fe-Ni-Si
   alloy. The interaction between small vacancy agglomerates and solute Al
   atoms is observed in the Fe-Ni-Al alloy under irradiation at 300-423 K.

AB Recent observations of photoactive silicon-vacancy (Si-V) color centers
   in diamond nanoparticles less than 10 nm in size has prompted interest
   in this material for optical labeling in biomedical applications. In
   order to be useful in such situations, these Si-V defects need to be in
   sufficient concentrations, and must be stable with respect to diffusion
   at room and body temperature. In this paper, density functional tight
   binding simulations are used to systematically examine the
   configuration, distribution and thermodynamic stability of the neutral
   and charged Si and Si-V centers in representative diamond nanocrystals.
   The results indicate that the stability of neutral Si-V is superior to
   other Si- related defects when the particle surfaces are suitability
   passivated, in agreement with PL measurements. Based on these results
   we show the size dependence, and thermal stability of this defect make
   fluorescent nanodiamond an ideal candidate for biomarkers.

AB Electrocatalyst stability is an important factor influencing the
   performance of polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells and is
   essential in maintaining the cell output. The aim of this work was to
   elucidate factors which influence the stability of platinum supported
   onto graphitic nanofibres (Pt/GNFs) and to compare the performance of
   these materials with the commonly used Pt/Vulcan electrocatalyst.
   Platinum nanoparticles (average diameter of 6.9 nm) were supported on
   GNFs which were prepared by chemical vapour deposition over an
   unsupported nickel oxide (NiO) catalyst precursor. The performance of
   Pt/GNFs based electrodes were studied by cyclic voltammetry and a
   single-cell fuel cell test and were compared with a commercially
   available carbon nanostructure, Vulcan XG-72, which was also
   impregnated with Pt nanoparticles. Characterisation of the pre- and
   post-operation of the Pt/GNFs by XRD and TEM showed that structural
   changes of the Pt had occurred during testing. It was found that the
   average diameter of each grain and the degree of agglomeration among
   particles was increased, creating elongated clusters of Pt along the
   carbon fibre. Analysis of electrocatalyst post-operation also
   identified that the sulphate from the Nafion membrane was reacting with
   the Pt surface forming platinum sulphide (PtS). These phases were
   confirmed by the presence of low intensity, but sharp XRD peaks,
   attributed to a few large diameter particles (49 nm). These two factors
   resulted in current density dropping from 0.2 A/cm(2) to 0.1 A/cm(2)
   (at 0.70 V) over a 25 h test period. (C) 2010 Professor T. Nejat

AB The low frequency hysteresis loops of superparamagnetic nanoparticles
   with uniaxial anisotropy are calculated as a function of the particle
   diameter, alternating magnetic field amplitude H-0, frequency, and
   particle magnetic parameters both for oriented and nonoriented
   assemblies. The magnetic field frequency is assumed so high, f > 50-100
   kHz, that the mechanical rotation of a particle in surrounding medium
   is restricted. Thus, only the Neel-Brown magnetization relaxation
   process is taken into account. Pronounced dependence of the specific
   loss power on the particle diameter is found in the linear regime
   pertaining to small magnetic field amplitudes. For an oriented assembly
   of Co nanoparticles with optimal diameter D approximate to 6 nm the
   specific power loss can be as high as 1600 W/g for typical values
   H-0=200 Oe and f=500 kHz. It is three times less for the corresponding
   nonoriented assembly. Nevertheless, using of particles with low
   anisotropy field, i.e., particles of soft magnetic type, seems to be
   preferable for the purpose of magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia. For
   such an assembly the nonlinear regime can be easily accessed. Hence the
   hysteresis loop area increases and is comparable with its maximum
   possible value. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

AB Fluorinated acrylic polymer (FAP) films have been impregnated with
   silver precursor (Ag(hfac)COD) by supercritical fluid technique and
   next irradiated with laser (lambda=532 nm). Laser-chemically reduced Ag
   atoms have been assembled into massifs of Ag nanoparticles (3-8 nm) in
   FAP/Ag(hfac)COD films matrix in the form of periodic layered
   nanostructures (horizontal to film surface) with unexpectedly short
   period (90 180 nm) The wavelet analysis of TEM images reveals the
   existence of even shorter-period structures in such films. Photolysis
   with non-coherent light or pyrolysis of FAP/Ag(hfac)COD film results in
   formation of Ag nanoparticles massifs but free of any periodic
   nanoparticle assemblies. Our interpretation of the observed effect of
   laser formation of short-period nano-sized Ag nanoparticle assemblies
   is based on self-enhanced interference process in the course of
   modification of optical properties of film.

SO JOURNAL OF OPTOELECTRONICS AND ADVANCED MATERIALS

   water
AB Initiation of nuclear reactions in Thorium nuclei is experimentally
   studied under laser exposure of Au nanoparticles suspended in the
   aqueous solution of Th(NO3)(4) (Th-232). The solutions are analyzed
   using either Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS) or gamma-spectrometry
   in the range of gamma-photons energy from 0.06 to 1.5 MeV. Real-time
   acquisition of gamma-spectra of the probes is achieved using a portable
   scintillator gamma-spectrometer. It is found that the reaction pathway
   depends on in which water, either H2O or D2O, the laser exposure is
   carried out. Laser exposure at peak intensity of 10(13) W/cm(2) in D2O
   results in the decrease of probes activity of all elements of Th
   branching including that of Cs-137 impurity. Exposure in H2O leads to
   the increase of activity of elements of Th branching as well as the one
   of the Cs-137 impurity due to fission of Th nuclei. Saturation of the
   liquids (H2O or D2O) with gaseous H-2 or D-2, respectively, enhances
   the nuclear reactions under laser exposure allowing their excitation at
   peak intensity as low as 10(10) W/cm(2). Enhanced activity of the probe
   is observed after the end of laser exposure for several hours.

AB Density functional calculations were performed to study the
   distribution of Au atoms in bimetallic PdAu nanoparticles. A series of
   Pd79-nAun clusters of truncated octahedral shape with different content
   of Au ranging from n = 1 to 60 was used to model such bimetallic
   nanosystems. Segregation of Au to the particle surface is found to be
   thermodynamically favorable. The most stable sites for Au substitution
   are located at the edges of the PdAu nanoclusters. The stabilization at
   the edges is rationalized by their higher flexibility for surface
   relaxation which minimizes the strain induced by larger atomic radius
   of Au as compared to Pd. This stabilization of Au at the edges
   indicates the possibility to synthesize PdAu particles with Pd atoms
   located mainly on the facets, and edges "decorated'' by Au atoms. Such
   nanocrystallites are expected to exhibit peculiar catalytic properties
   and, being thermodynamically stable, should be prone to retaining their
   initial shape under catalytic conditions.

AB Dynamic magnetic hysteresis in uniaxial superparamagnetic nanoparticles
   in superimposed ac and dc magnetic fields of arbitrary amplitude is
   considered using Brown's model of coherent rotation of the
   magnetization. The dependence of the area of the dynamic hysteresis
   loop on the temperature, frequency, and ac and dc bias fields is
   analyzed. In particular, the dynamic hysteresis loop of a single-domain
   ferromagnetic particle is substantially altered by applying a
   relatively weak dc field. Furthermore, it is shown that at intermediate
   to low ac field amplitudes, the dc bias field permits tuning of the
   magnetic power absorption of the particles, while for strong ac field
   amplitudes the effect becomes entirely analogous to that produced by
   the exchange biased anisotropy. Simple analytical formulas are provided
   in the linear response regime for the steady-state magnetization and
   loop area, exhibiting perfect agreement with the numerical solution of
   Brown's Fokker-Planck equation. Comparison with previous results is
   also given. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics. [doi:

AB In optics, chirality is typically associated with circularly polarized

   materials with linearly polarized light. We performed Second Harmonic
   Generation (SHG) microscopy on G-shaped planar chiral nanostructures
   made of gold. The SHG response originates in distinctive hotspots,
   whose arrangement is dependent of the handedness. These results uncover
   new directions for studying chirality in artificial materials. (C) 2010

AB In vivo photoacoustic (PA) flow cytometry (PAFC) has great potential
   for detecting disease-associated biomarkers in blood and lymph flow, as
   well as real-time control of the efficacy of photothermal (PT) and
   other therapies through the counting of circulating abnormal objects.
   We report on a high speed PAFC with a Nd:YAG laser having a 0.5-MHz
   pulse repetition rate at a wavelength of 1064 nm, pulse width of 10 ns,
   and energy up to 100 mu J. This is the first biomedical application of
   PA and PT techniques operating at the highest pulse repetition rate of
   nanosecond lasers that provide 100-fold enhancement in detection speed
   of carbon nanotube clusters, as well as real-time monitoring of the
   flow velocity of individual targets through the width of PA signals.
   The laser pulse rate limits for PT and PA techniques depending on the
   sizes of laser beam and targets and flow velocity are discussed. We
   propose time-overlapping mode and generation of periodic nano-and
   microbubbles as PA-signal and PT-therapy amplifiers, including
   discrimination of small absorbing targets among large ones. Taking into
   account the relatively low level of background signals from most
   biotissues at 1064 nm, our data suggest that a nanosecond Nd: YAG laser
   operating at high pulse repetition rate could be a promising optical
   source for time-resolved PA and PT cytometry, imaging, microscopy, and
   therapy, including detection of nanoparticles and cells flowing at
   velocities up to 2.5 m/s. (C) 2010 Optical Society of America

AB Ab initio methods of the density functional theory and pseudopotentials
   were used to study the structure, electronic states, total energy and
   tensile strength of WC nanoparticles. It has been found that the very
   small particles (having less than 15 WC atomic pairs) have a cube-like
   NaCl structure. Particles with trigonal and cubic structures have
   approximately the same energies in the region of 10-20 WC pairs;
   however, the local atomic structure keeps the NaCl-like alternation of
   W and C atoms. The WC15 trigonal particle was used as a typical one to
   study the WC nanoparticle tensile strength. It has been found that W
   and C vacancies decrease the tensile strength, but not drastically.
   Electronic structure of nanoparticles looks like that of bulk fcc-WC
   with a large density of states at the Fermi level. (C) 2010 Elsevier

AB Gold and zinc nanoparticles were obtained in AOT reverse micelles in
   isooctane by reduction of the corresponding metal ions by the natural
   pigment quercetin (the biochemical synthesis technique). Gold and zinc
   ions were introduced into the micellar solution of quercetin in the
   form of aqueous solutions, HAuCl4 and [Zn(NH3)(4)]SO4, to the water to
   AOT molar ratios 1-3 and 3-4, respectively. The process of nanoparticle
   formation was investigated by spectrophotometry. Nanoparticle size and
   shape were determined by transmission electron microscopy. The data
   obtained allow to conclude that there are two steps in metal
   ion-quercetin interaction: (1) complex formation, and (2) complex
   dissociation with subsequent formation of nanoparticles and a second
   product, presumably oxidized quercetin. Gold nanoparticles were found
   to be of various shapes (spheres, hexahedrons, triangles, and
   cylinders) and sizes, mainly in the 10-20 nm range; zinc nanoparticles
   are chiefly spherical and similar to 5 nm in size. In both cases, the
   nanoparticles are stable in the air in micellar solution over long
   periods of time (from a several months to a several years).

AB We combine the fabrication of Au and Au/Ag core/shell nanorods (NRs),
   as well as experimental measurements of vis-NIR extinction,
   unpolarized, and cross-polarized light scattering spectra, with
   T-matrix and separation-of-variables simulations, to gain insight into
   the relation between the morphology/composition of nanoparticles and
   their isotropic and anisotropic optical responses. Using several Au and
   Au/Ag core/shell NR samples, we present unambiguous experimental
   evidence of a tunable correlation between the longitudinal plasmon
   resonances of NRs and their spectral depolarization maxima. For gold
   NRs, the depolarization maxima follow the extinction plasmon resonances
   blue-shifted from 80 to 270 nm. In contrast, the depolarization maximum
   of Au/Ag NRs is located just near the longitudinal resonance, and the
   spectral shift of the depolarization maximum is about 10 to 20 nm. The
   experimental extinction and depolarization spectra of gold NRs are in
   good agreement with T-matrix simulations based on TEM-fitted models
   that account for the aspect ratio polydispersity and byproduct
   contributions. For composite Au/Ag NRs, the separation-of-variables
   simulations provide a calibration curve that correlates the relative
   spectral shift of the extinction resonance with the silver shell
   thicknesses and generates experimental data that are in good agreement
   with estimations based on the Ag/Au mass ratio.

AB Cobalt-filled carbon nanotubes were synthesized at high temperature and
   high gas pressure. A high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
   study demonstrates that the product of the synthesis contains
   cylindrical carbon nanotubes whose cores are filled with cobalt
   nanoparticles or nanorods. It is shown that cobalt appears inside the
   nanotubes in three basic modifications: face-centered cubic (fcc)
   lattice, hexagonal close-packed (hcp) lattice and disordered polytypic
   structure. The fee lattice is often twinned, with two or more
   non-parallel twinning planes being observed. The orientations of the
   fcc and hcp cobalt particles with respect to the nanotubes were
   investigated. The authors believe that the variety of cobalt
   modifications inside the nanotubes is due to the process of segregation
   of the closely packed structures from the melt. (C) 2009 Acta

   the polyelectrolyte-coated living Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cells using
   the polyelectrolyte-mediated layer-by-layer approach. Synthetic
   polyelectrolytes poly(allylamine hydrochloride) and poly(sodium
   4-styreiiesulfoilate) were layer-by-layer deposited on the surfaces of
   the yeast cells followed by the deposition of water-soluble oxidized
   multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and an additional Outermost
   polyelectrolyte bilayer. This resulted in the fabrication of
   polyelectrolyte/nanotubes composite coatings on the cell walls of the
   yeast cells, which could be clearly seen using the conventional optical
   microscopy. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy was applied
   to further investigate the composite coatings. Viability of the
   encapsulated cells was confirmed using the intercellular esterase
   activity test. Finally, electrochemical studies using voltammetry and
   electrochemical impedance measurements were performed, indicating that
   the composite polyelectrolytes/MWNTs coatings sufficiently affect the
   electron mediation between the encapsulated yeast cells and the
   artificial electron acceptor, making it possible to distinguish between
   living and dead cells. The technique described here may Find potential
   application ill the development of microelectronic devices, core-shell
   and hollow composite microparticles, and electrochemical cell-based
   biosensors.

AB The dynamic behavior of the catalytic CO oxidation reaction on the
   metal surfaces (Pt. Pd) of different structures (single crystals
   Pt(100), Pd(110): microcrystals (Pt, Pd tips); nanoparticles
   (Pd/support)) has been studied experimentally by FEM, HREELS, TPR, TDS,
   MB techniques and kinetic Monte Carlo modeling. The CO, O-2 adsorption
   and CO +O-2 reaction was studied by HREELS,TPR and TDS. Sharp tips of
   Pt and Pd, several hundreds angstroms in radius, were used to perform
   in situ investigations of the dynamic surface processes by FEM. HREELS
   studies on the Pt(100) surface demonstrate that the self-oscillations
   and waves propagation are connected with periodic changes in the
   Surface structure of nanoplane (100)-(hex) <-> (1 x 1), varying the
   catalytic property of metal. The fundamentally different feedback
   mechanism generating the kinetic oscillations has been identified on
   the Pd surfaces: the reversible subsurface oxygen formation, which
   modifies the adsorption and catalytic properties of the surface. Based
   on experimental results, two models for the CO +O-2 reaction on Pt(1
   00) and Pd(1 10) surfaces are proposed for stochastic Monte Carlo
   modeling. Carbon monoxide spillover was taken into account in the
   stochastic model of oscillatory CO oxidation reaction over model Pd
   supported nanoparticles. The presence of COads spillover determines the
   character of concentration waves over the Pd nanoparticle
   surface-oxygen wave propagates from the central particle part to the
   particle/support perimeter:-carbon monoxide wave moves in the opposite
   direction. The comprehensive study of CO, O-2 adsorption and CO + O-2
   reaction in a row: single crystals -> tips -> nanoparticles have shown
   an identical nature of active centres over these metal surfaces. (C)

AB The self-organization of solutions of organic and inorganic polymers on
   the surface of round fibers during the evaporation of a solvent leads
   to the formation of longitudinal and transverse periodic structures.
   The structure period ranges from several tens to several hundreds of
   microns and depends on the type of polymer, the initial solution
   composition, and the fiber diameter. Nanoporous periodic structures
   made of inorganic materials can be formed from a suspension of
   inorganic nanoparticles in a polymer solution upon thermal

   paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra including resonance lines due to
   the paramagnetic Fe3+-V-o site with axially disturbed ligand field, and
   due to S-state Fe3+ ions (S = 5/2 and L = 0) substituted into the
   titanium site coordinated by six oxygen atoms in the Ti4+-centered unit
   cell, were observed. It has been revealed that the implantation of Fe
   ions into SrTiO3 produces a remarkable ferromagnetic behavior. The
   ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and magnetization measurements revealed
   an out-of-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy in Fe-implanted SrTiO3.
   The observed phenomena are discussed on the basis of strong magnetic
   dipolar interaction between Fe nanoparticles due to the decreasing
   interparticle distance with increasing implantation fluence. (C) 2009

AB Mg-based nanocomposites are promising candidates for hydrogen storage
   applications exhibiting fast H-sorption kinetics at reasonably low
   temperatures when processed by high-energy ball milling techniques.
   However, since compaction of the highly reactive nanometric powder is
   desirable before application, the search for other effective processing
   routes for the preparation of Mg-based nanocomposites is relevant. In
   this work, we have used a combination of equal channel angular
   pressing, cold rolling and high-energy ball milling in the processing
   of the commercial AZ31 extruded alloy to evaluate its use as a hydrogen
   storage material. Severe plastic deformation carried out at different
   temperatures. combined with further mechanical processing resulted in a
   controlled texture and signifiant grain refinement, which are desirable
   microstructural characteristics for hydrogen storage applications.

AB A method for fast air purification using high concentration aerosol of
   TiO2 nanoparticles is evaluated in a model chemical catastrophe
   involving toxic vapors of diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP). Mice are
   used as human model in a closed 100 dm(3) chamber. Exposure of mice to
   37 ppm of DFP vapor for 15 min resulted in acute poisoning. Spraying
   TiO2 aerosol in 2 min after the start of exposure to DFP vapors
   resulted in quick removal of DFP vapors from the chamber's air. Animals
   did not show signs of poisoning after the decontamination experiment
   and exposure to TiO2 aerosol alone. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
   antioxidant activity (AOA) of mice blood plasma were measured for
   animals exposed to sound of aerosol generator, DFP vapors,TiO2 aerosol
   and DFP vapors + TiO2 aerosol. Reduced ROS and increased AOA were found
   for mice exposure to sound, DFP and TiO2 aerosol. Exposure to DFP and
   decontamination with TiO2 nanoparticles resulted in decreased AOA in 48
   h following the exposure. The results suggest that application of TiO2
   aerosol is a powerful method of air purification from toxic
   hydrolysable compounds with moderate health aftermaths and requires
   further study and optimization. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

ID NANOPARTICLES; RESONANCE; ELECTRON
AB The nature of a puzzling high-temperature ferromagnetism of doped
   mixed-valent vanadium oxide nanotubes reported earlier by Krusin-Elbaum
   et al., Nature, 431 (2004) 672, has been addressed by static
   magnetization, muon spin relaxation, nuclear magnetic and electron spin
   resonance spectroscopy techniques. A precise control of the charge
   doping was achieved by electrochemical Li intercalation. We find that
   it provides excess electrons, thereby increasing the number of
   interacting magnetic vanadium sites, and, at a certain doping level,
   yields a ferromagnetic-like response persisting up to room temperature.
   Thus we confirm the surprising previous results on the samples prepared
   by a completely different intercalation method. Moreover our
   spectroscopic data provide first ample evidence for the bulk nature of
   the effect. In particular, they enable a conclusion that the Li
   nucleates superparamagnetic nanosize spin clusters around the
   intercalation site which are responsible for the unusual
   high-temperature ferromagnetism of vanadium oxide nanotubes. Copyright

ID OXIDATION; FILMS; PRESSURE
AB The methods of atomic force microscopy combined with the digital
   processing of images were used to study the change in the morphology of
   nanostructured metal-oxide coatings obtained by reactive evaporation at
   10(-6) torr in the atmosphere of oxygen and further low-temperature
   iron afteroxidation in an air atmosphere at different temperatures. It
   is shown that a nanostructured layer with a unimodal distribution
   according to the size and degree of nonsphericity of the particle is
   formed in the case of sputtering. Using the sample detection methods,
   it is shown that a unimodal distribution is transformed into a bimodal
   distribution at an increase in the reoxidation temperature from 50 to
   200A degrees C, after which it becomes a trimodal distribution, which
   proves that the building blocks of a nanostructured layer are
   nanoparticles and four- and 16-particle surface nanoparticle
   conglomerates. This structure can explain the functional properties of
   these coatings, which are of practical importance.

AB A simple layer-by-layer method to coat the bacterial cells with gold
   and silver nanoparticles (AuNPs and AgNPs) for the acquisition of
   surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectra is reported. First,
   the bacteria cell wall is coated with poly (allylamine hydrochloride)
   (PAH), a positively charged polymer, and then with citrate reduced Au
   or AgNPs. In order to increase the stability of the coating, another
   layer of PAH is prepared on the surface. The SEM and AFM images
   indicate that the nanoparticles are in the form of both isolated and
   aggregated nanoparticles on the bacterial wall. The coating of
   bacterial cells with AgNPs or AuNPs not only serves for their
   preparation for SERS measurement but also helps to visualize the coated
   of bacterial cells under the ordinary white-light microscope objective
   due to efficient light-scattering properties of Au and AgNPs. A
   comparative study single versus aggregates of bacterial cells is also
   demonstrated for possible single bacterial detection with SERS. The two
   bacteria that differ in shape and cell wall biochemical structure,
   Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus cohnii, Gram-negative and
   -positive, respectively, are used as models. The preliminary results
   reveal that the approach could be used for single bacterial cell
   identification.

AB A new technique of growing nanocrytalline silicon (nc-Si) thin films is
   suggested. The technique involves the centrifuge-assisted
   size-selective deposition of nanoparticles from a colloidal solution
   (sol) containing nc-Si powders. The structural and optical parameters
   of the initial nc-Si powders and films deposited by the newly suggested
   procedure are studied by transmission electron microscopy and analysis
   of absorption spectra and Raman spectra. The absorption coefficient of
   the nc-Si films increases with decreasing dimensions of the constituent
   nanoparticles. The experimentally measured band gap of the films, E
   (g), is widened from 1.8 to 2.2. eV on etching the nc-Si powders used
   for deposition of the corresponding films. On the basis of the analysis
   of the Raman spectra, it is suggested that the amorphous component is
   involved in the nc-Si powders and films due to oxygen atoms arranged at
   the nanoparticle surface.

   that of ferromagnetic nanowires arrays. An extended Monte Carlo model
   taking into account the influence of both, the magnetic anisotropy and
   magnetostatic interactions of dipolar origin between ferromagnetic
   nanoparticles chains, has been developed. The existence of a maximum in
   thermomagnetic curves for applied magnetic fields up to 2.5 times the
   anisotropy field value of the system, and the coexistence of positive
   and negative magnetocaloric effect have been predicted confirming the
   experimental results found in highly ordered arrays of ferromagnetic

AB In the first part of this paper we outline the state of the art in the
   field of magnetic nanoparticles in oxide glasses. We describe the
   theoretical background of two complementary techniques used for the
   studies of the state of paramagnetic ions, clusters and magnetic
   particles in a diamagnetic matrix, viz., magnetooptical Faraday
   rotation (FR) and electron magnetic resonance (EMIR) and we overview
   previous results obtained with these techniques for several glass
   systems. In the second part, we highlight the case of
   potassium-alumina-borate glasses - a glassy system where doping with
   paramagnetic oxides results in formation of magnetic particles at very
   low contents of paramagnetic additions: Fe2O3 and MnO. In the special
   case when the ratio of the iron and manganese oxides in the charge is
   3/2, magnetic nanoparticles with characteristics close to those of
   manganese ferrite are formed already at the first stage of the glass
   preparation. After thermal treatment all glasses show FR and EMR
   spectra attesting to the presence of superparamagnetic nanoparticles,
   characterized by relatively broad size and shape distributions. The
   formation of magnetic nanoparticles confers to these glasses magnetic
   and magnetooptical properties typical of magnetically ordered
   substances. At the same time, the glasses remain transparent in a part
   of the visible and near infrared spectral range and display a high FR
   value. Such properties make them particularly interesting for use as
   new media for various magneto-optical devices. (C) 2009 WILEY-VCH

AB We suggest an alternative way of terahertz radiation generation
   utilizing the effect of spontaneous symmetry breaking in a nonlinear
   metallic nanodimer illuminated by light. We show that the symmetry
   breaking is caused by instability of plasmon eigenmodes of the system
   and can lead either to spontaneous magnetization of the dimer or to a
   periodic self-modulation regime of light scattering. We find that the
   modulation frequency lies in the terahertz band and may be tuned within

AB In this work we study the kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction on
   carbon-supported Ru nanoparticles modified with various amounts of Se.
   Rotating disk electrode is used to determine kinetic currents for the
   ORR in 0.1 M H2SO4 at 298 K and O-2 partial pressures from 1 to0.01
   atm. The dependence of the ORR activity on Se/Ru ratio shows
   volcano-type behavior with ca. 10 fold increase of the mass activity at
   0.1 < Se/Ru < 0.3. The reaction order in O-2 is close to I in the
   interval of overpotentials from 0.4 to 0.7 V, and is independent of the
   presence of Se. Regardless the amount of Se, the Tafel slope
   demonstrates continuous increase from ca. 70 mV/dec at 0.4 V to ca. 140
   mV/dec at 0.6 V overpotential. In situ EXAFS spectra are measured at Ru
   K-edge (in the transmission mode) and Se K-edge (in the fluorescence
   mode) in argon and oxygen saturated 0.1 M H2SO4 solutions in the
   interval of electrode potentials from 0.050 to 0.750 V RHE. The data
   are used to explore the surface state changes of Ru and RuxSey
   particles and clarify the promoting role of Se during the ORR. (C) 2009

AB In this contribution recent results on selective and precise tailoring
   of triangular gold nanoparticles (NPs) using ns-pulsed laser light are
   presented. The NPs were prepared by nanosphere lithography and
   subsequently tailored with ns-pulsed laser light using different
   fluences and wavelengths. The method is based on the size and shape
   dependent localized surface plasmon polariton resonance (SPR) of the
   NPs. We will demonstrate that the gap size between triangular NPs can
   be tuned from approximately 102 +/- 14 nm to 122 +/- 11 nm, due to a
   shape change of the NP from triangular to oblate. These morphological
   changes are accompanied by a significant shift of the surface plasmon
   resonance from lambda(SPR) - 730 nm to lambda(SPR) - 680 nm. Most
   importantly if the laser wavelength is chosen such that the dipolar SPR
   is excited, the hexagonal order of the NPs remains intact after
   irradiation, in contrast to excitation via the quadrupole SPR or within
   the interband transition. A tuneable gap size and the conservation of
   the hexagonal order of the NP array is the precondition for
   applications, where the NPs should serve as anchor points, e. g. for
   functional molecular nanowires, which can be used to utilize molecular
   devices. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB Enhancement of microwave radiation at wavelength lambda similar to 10
   cm in a cavity is simulated using the system of constituent equations
   derived earlier. It is shown that a radiation energy density of W
   similar to 1000 J/m(3) can be attained. Pumping of the medium
   containing conducting nanoparticles is carried out with a stationary
   electric field. The required mass concentration of nanoparticles and
   pumping field are estimated. A method of obtaining active medium using
   a statitionary electric field for enhancement of microwave radiation in
   a wavelength range of lambda similar to 10 cm is proposed. In this
   method, extended conducting nanoparticles should be sputtered.

AB To clarify the impact of fossil fuel combustion particles' composition
   on their capacity to take up water, we apply a laboratory approach in
   which the method of deposition of compounds, identified in the
   particulate coverage of diesel and aircraft engine soot particles, is
   developed. It is found that near-monolayer organic/inorganic coverage
   of the soot particles may be represented by three groups of fossil fuel
   combustion-derived particulate matter with respect to their Hansh's
   coefficients related to hydrophilic properties. Water adsorption
   measurements show that nonpolar organics (aliphatic and aromatic
   hydrocarbons) lead to hydrophobization of the soot surface. Acidic
   properties of organic compounds such as those of oxidized PAHs, ethers,
   ketones, aromatic, and aliphatic acids are related to higher water
   uptake, whereas inorganic acids and ionic compounds such as salts of
   organic acids are shown to be responsible for soot hydrophilization.
   This finding allows us to quantify the role of the chemical identity of
   soot surface compounds in water uptake and the water interaction with
   fossil fuel combustion particles in the humid atmosphere.

   enables one to avoid N-fold integration in the mathematical expressions

ID ENERGY-TRANSFER; MIXED NANOSTRUCTURES; NANOPARTICLES; EU(III)
AB The mechanism of columinescence (fluorescence sensitization) of dyes
   incorporated in nanostructures of metal complexes is studied. It is
   shown for the first time that the columinescence of dyes is due to the
   transfer of excitation energy from ligands and metal ions of complexes
   that form nanostructures. It is proven that the dye columinescence of
   rhodamine 6G (R6G) molecules incorporated into nanostructures of
   Al(DBM)(3)phen, Al(DBM) (n) (OH)(6 - 2n) , and Eu(DBM)(3)phen (DBM is
   dibenzoylmethane) nanostructures is completely determined by the
   singlet excitation energy migration from ligands to R6G molecules. It
   is shown that, at small concentrations of R6G, the R6G columinescence
   intensity is lower in nanostructures of metal complexes with a high
   probability of S-T conversion and that this difference disappears at
   large concentrations of R6G. In the case of Nile blue (whose S (1)
   level lies below the (5) D (0) level of Eu(III)) incorporated in
   nanostructures of Eu(DBM)(3)phen complexes, as well as in
   nanostructures of Al(DBM)(3)phen and Gd(DBM)(3)phen complexes with
   admixture of Eu complexes, we observed the S-S energy transfer from DBM
   to NB in addition to the delayed sensitized fluorescence of NB
   previously observed in nanostructures of Eu complexes, which was caused
   by the energy transfer from the (5) D (0) level of Eu(III) to NB. At
   dye concentrations below 100 nM, the efficiency of NB sensitization due
   to the migration of singlet excitation energy from DBM is lower than in
   the case of the energy transfer from Eu(III) ions, while, at large
   concentrations of the dye, the S-S energy transfer successfully
   competes with the sensitization of NB by Eu(III) ions. The use of dye
   columinescence makes it possible to easily determine dye concentrations
   of 2-100 nM in solutions with standard spectrofluorimeters.

AB The nonequilibrium dynamics of a probe in a driven binary mixture of
   effective hard-sphere particles has been measured computationally in
   molecular dynamics simulations so as to obtain a better understanding
   of the energy and spatial correlations that persist through the
   coupling between the binary components. The driving of the particles is
   manifested through a change of the effective volume (or equivalently,
   diameter of the hard spheres) and each component is assumed to have a
   different time-dependent profile. Such a driving is possible in a
   suspension of one-component colloidal mesogens, for example, in which
   the particle volume has been seen to change with pH or temperature
   changes in the solution. It can also be realized by growing
   nanoparticles during a nucleation process. The full particle dynamics
   has been projected onto Langevin-type models of the probe motion by
   representing the environment using two different reservoirs and
   distinct bath-probe coupling coefficients with different nonstationary
   properties. The bath particles corresponding to each reservoir swell
   with time at various rates, nonsynchronously changing their volume
   fractions. Under the assumption of a weak bath-bath interactions, the
   coupling coefficients between the probe and two baths are expressed via
   those in the case of a simple-consisting of one bath-environment. The
   general form of the resulting irreversible Langevin equation is in
   agreement with the MD simulations of a hard sphere probe particle
   diffusing in the nonstationary binary mixture. (C) 2009 American

AB One step (direct) and multisteps synthesis methods of metal and oxide
   nanoparticles are presented including both bottom-up and top-down
   procedures. Chemical methods involving the polyol process allows to get
   either isotropic or anisotropic nanoparticles. Nanowires, nanorods and
   dumbells can be generated either by heterogeneous nucleation or by
   using a template (mesoporous silica). Top-down procedures are
   illustrated by laser irradiation of immersed bulk targets (Ag, Au)
   which generates self-organized nanostructures or colloidal solutions.
   Laser irradiation of these colloidal solutions modifies the size
   distribution and the shape of nanoparticles. Bimetallic nanoparticles
   are generated from mixtures of monometallic colloidal solutions.
   Surface-mediated methods involving a host support and an invited phase
   are also presented. They lead to the formation of metal or oxide
   clusters and nanoparticles. The speciation of these entities is
   correlated with the observed catalytic performances.

AB This study reports the discovery of the universal
   surfactant-polyoxipropylene, which maximally extends the range of
   carrier fluids for magnetic colloids. A magnetic fluid on the base of
   ethyl alcohol has been synthesized and its magnetic and rheological
   properties have been investigated. It has been found that the magnetic
   nanoparticles are covered by a monolayer of surfactant molecules. The
   fluid preserves fluidity at temperatures as low as -100 degrees C.
   Coagulation stability, with respect to the added kerosene, has been
   explored. It is suggested to use this effect for preparing the
   magnetocontrollable extractors of ethyl alcohol. (C) 2009 American

AB The diagonal and off-diagonal components of the effective permeability
   tensor and the effective permittivity of three-dimensional (3D)
   periodic magnetic nanosystems, depending on the size and separation of
   the magnetic nanoparticles, were calculated using the computed values
   of the propagation constants and the dispersion relations of clockwise
   and counterclockwise polarized electromagnetic waves (EMWs), as well as
   for the ordinary and extraordinary modes in the gyromagnetic medium.
   The propagation constants of EMWs in a 3D periodic array of 150 nm iron
   nanospheres in a dielectric matrix, depending on the ratio of the
   period of the array to the radius of the nanospheres, were obtained at
   a frequency f = 30 GHz for longitudinal and transverse orientations of
   the bias magnetic field. It is shown that the magnetic and dielectric
   losses of weakly interacting systems are lower than that of yttrium
   iron garnet (YIG); however, losses increase due to spin wave (SW)
   excitations upon reduced separation. (C) 2009 American Institute of

AB The effects of the molar ratio of sodium sulfide to chloroauric acid in
   the range of 0.5 to 5 and the time factor on the formation of the
   nanoparticles (NPs) of metallic Au, Au2S or their mixtures have been
   studied applying in situ and ex situ techniques (UV-Vis absorption
   spectroscopy, potentiometry, TEM, SPM, SERS, XPS). The products and
   intermediates have been compared with those for the reduction of
   chloroaurate with citrate ions and combinations of citrate and sulfide
   ions. An increase in the concentration of sulfide ions accelerates the
   reduction of Au(III) complexes but hinders the nucleation and growth of
   Au NPs, resulting in a prolonged period before the appearance of
   plasmon peaks. The electrochemical potential is not directly associated
   with the plasmon intensities, although the potential sharply decreases
   simultaneously with a blue shift of the near-IR peak emerging with the
   Na2S/HAuCl4 ratios of 0.5 to 1.5. It was concluded that the peak is due
   to longitudinal plasmon resonance of gold nanoplates. Au2S NPs, the
   nucleation of which is effectively inhibited, and probably some
   structures and fragments visible in TEM and AFM, including 2-5 nm Au
   NPs, crystallize in part outside the solutions. The evidence of
   partially liquid mesoscale structures comprising intermediate gold
   species as precursors of nanoparticles is presented, and their origin,
   ex situ transformation and role in the reaction mechanisms are
   discussed.

AB The present paper reviews our investigations concerning the mechanism
   of H-2 + O-2 reaction on the metal surfaces (Pt, Pd) at different
   structures: single crystals (Pt(111), Pt(100), Pd(110)); microcrystals
   (Pt tips); and nanoparticles (Pd-Ti3+/TiO2). Field electron microscopy
   (FEM), field ion microscopy (FIM), high-resolution electron energy loss
   spectroscopy (HREELS), XPS, UPS, work function (WF), TDS and
   temperature-programmed reaction (TPR) methods have been applied to
   study the kinetics of H-2 oxidation on a nanolevel. The adsorption of
   both O-2 and H-2 and several dissociative products (H-ods, O-ads,
   OHads) was studied by HREELS. Using the DFT technique the equilibrium
   states and stretching vibrations of H, O, OH, H2O, adsorbed on the
   Pt(111) surface, have been calculated depending on the surrounding of
   the metal atoms. Sharp tips of Pt, several hundreds angstroms in
   radius, were used to perform in situ investigations of the dynamic
   surface processes. The FEM and FIM studies on the Pt-tip surface
   demonstrate that the self-oscillations and waves propagations are
   connected with periodic changes in the surface structure of nanoplane
   (100)-(hex) <-> (1 x 1), varying the catalytic property of metal. The
   role of defects (Ti3+-square(O)) in the adsorption centers formation,
   their stabilization by the palladium nanoparticles, and then the
   defects participation in H-2 + O-2 steady-state reaction over
   Pd-Ti3+/TiO2 surface have been studied by XPS, UPS and photodesorption
   techniques (PhDS). This reaction seems to involve the "protonate"
   hydrogen atoms (H+/TiOx) as a result of spillover effect: diffusion of
   H-ads atoms from Pd particles on a TiOx surface. The comprehensive
   study of H-2, O-2 adsorption and H-2 + O-2 reaction in a row: single
   crystals -> tips -> nanoparticles has shown the same nature of active
   centers over these metal surfaces. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   the theory of magnetic resonance. The results of these experiments were
   earlier interpreted within the radical-pair model of magnetoreception.
   However, the consistent analysis shows that the amplitudes of the RF
   fields used are far too small to noticeably influence electron spins in
   organic radicals. Other possible agents that could mediate the birds'
   response to the RF fields are discussed, but apparently no known
   physical system can be responsible for this effect. Bioelectromagnetics

AB The processes of melting and crystallization of copper nanoclusters
   with a radius ranging from 0.69 to 3.05 nm have been investigated using
   the molecular dynamics simulation. The performed simulation has shown
   that the melting begins with the surface of the cluster. Another
   feature of this phase transition is that it occurs in a temperature
   range where the liquid and solid phases can coexist. However, it is
   found that, for small copper clusters, the melting and crystallization
   temperatures coincide with each other. Moreover, it is established that
   the parent face-centered cubic structure of these small clusters (N <
   150 atoms) transforms into a structure with fivefold symmetry even at
   temperatures of the order of 150-170 K. The behavior of some
   thermodynamic characteristics of copper nanoclusters is investigated in
   the vicinity of the solid-liquid phase transition. Analysis of the data
   obtained has revealed a number of regularities that are in agreement
   with the results of analytical calculations. In particular, the melting
   and crystallization temperatures of copper nanoparticles are linear
   functions of N (-1/3). However, the melting heat Delta H (m) and the
   melting entropy Delta S (m) vary in a more complex manner. It is noted
   that the formation of a cluster structure depends on the conditions
   used for cooling from the liquid phase. Slow cooling results
   predominantly in the formation of a face-centered cubic phase, whereas
   rapid cooling in the majority of cases leads to the formation of an
   icosahedral modification. Therefore, the simulation performed has
   demonstrated the possibility of controlling the formation of a
   structure of copper nanoclusters during crystallization.

AB Regularities of the self-organization of ensembles of nanoparticles
   into crystalline structures in metal lyosols are studied by the
   Brownian dynamics. Van der Waals, elastic, and electrostatic
   interparticle interactions, as well as the action of dissipative and
   fluctuation forces are taken into account in the model. Pair
   interaction potentials for the polydisperse ensembles of particles are
   analyzed and the correlations between the pattern of potential curves
   and the type of formed structures (from crystalline to fractal) are
   revealed. The effect of interparticle tangential friction on the degree
   of ordering of formed structures is studied. It is demonstrated that
   this factor can determine the degree of ordering of nanoparticle
   aggregates. An essentially new approach to describing elastic
   interactions of nanoparticles of polymer-containing sols is implemented.

AB Ion implantation is a convenient tool for synthesis of silicon
   nanocrystals in SiO2 matrix which exhibit strong red/near-IR
   luminescence at room temperature. Ion beams can be successfully used
   also for controllable modification of the nanostructures by introducing
   defects or changing their phase composition. In the present work, both
   possibilities are tested by implantation of carbon into thermal SiO2
   films either containing pre-fabricated Si nanocrystals or as-implanted
   with Si. In the carbon-free SiO2 films, Si nanocrystals were
   synthesized at typical Si excess of about 10 at.% and annealing
   temperatures of 1000 and 1100 degrees C. It is shown that carbon ion
   irradiation of the Si-implanted and then annealed SiO2 films completely
   quenches a luminescence band at 650-850 nm related to Si nanocrystals
   and gives rise to emission in the range of 350-650 nm that originated
   from oxygen-deficient defects. The subsequent final thermal treatment
   reduces concentration of the matrix defects, but only partially
   recovers photoluminescence from Si nanocrystals depending on the C
   dose. The latter is explained by the hindering effect of implanted
   carbon on growth and crystallization of Si phase inclusions. Strong
   "white" emission in the spectral range of 350-800 nm is observed only
   for the equal Si and C concentrations, irrespective of the sequence of
   carbon introduction and Si nanocrystal formation. This broad spectral
   band consists of the three sub-bands at around 400, 500 and 620 nm
   attributed to inclusions of SiC, C and Si phases, respectively.
   Electron spectroscopy analysis of the annealed layers confirms the
   presence of silicon carbide phase and carbon precipitates showing the
   diamond-like sp(3), not the graphitic sp(2) hybridization. The Si- and
   C-rich nanoclusters with a size of 3-5 nm were identified in the
   co-implanted films by electron microscopy as amorphous nanoparticles.

AB Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles are extensively used today in
   sunscreens and coatings as protective compounds for human skin and
   material surfaces from UV radiation. In this paper, such particles are
   investigated by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy as sources
   of free radicals under UV irradiation. The surface density of a placebo
   with embedded particles corresponds to the recommendations of
   dermatologists (2 mg cm(-2)). It is revealed that if applied onto
   glass, small particles 25 nm in diameter produce an increased amount of
   free radicals compared to the larger ones of 400 nm diam and the
   placebo itself. However, if applied onto porcine skin in vitro, there
   is no statistically distinct difference in the amount of radicals
   generated by the two kinds of particles on skin and by the skin itself.
   This proves that although particles as part of sunscreens produce free
   radicals, the effect is negligible in comparison to the production of
   radicals by skin in vitro. (C) 2009 Society of Photo-Optical

AB A relation was established between the composition of Cd (x) Zn1-x S
   nanoparticles and their ability to accumulate excess negative charge
   during irradiation. The rate of expenditure of the accumulated charge
   depends on the composition of the nanoparticles and is determined by
   their electric capacitance. A correlation was found between the
   photocatalytic activity of the Cd (x) Zn1-x S nanoparticles in the
   release of hydrogen from solutions of Na2SO3, their composition, and
   their capacity for photoinduced accumulation of excess charge. It was
   shown that Ni-0 nanoparticles photodeposited on the surface of Cd (x)
   Zn1-x S are effective cocatalysts for the release of hydrogen. It was
   found that Zn-II additions in photocatalytic systems based on Cd (x)
   Zn1-x S/Ni-0 nanostructures have a promoting action on the release of
   hydrogen from water-ethanol mixtures.

   (UV) radiation by embedding of 35-200-nm-sized particles of titanium

   light is of major importance due to increased frequency of skin cancer
   provoked by excessive doses of accepted UV radiation. For 310-nm light,
   the optimal sizes of the TiO2 and Si particles are found to be 62 and
   55 nm, respectively, and for 400-nm radiation, 122 and 70 nm,

AB AC and dc magnetic measurements in temperature interval 5-350 K and at
   external magnetic field H <= 5 T were employed to probe the finite-size
   and nonstoichiometry effects on magnetic ordering of La0.5Ca0.5MnO3
   half-doped manganite compound. It is shown that the complex mixed
   magnetic ordering in bulk samples appears to be unstable regarding the
   both effects. The strongest one is the size effect, suppressing the
   mixed order and inducing the ferromagnetic-like one, which is
   characteristic also for other half-doped manganites. The small
   variations in cation composition (nonstoichiometry), which don't
   influence the crystal structure, lead to strong perturbations in the
   mixed magnetic ordering of the bulk. The results obtained are discussed
   in the terms of pronounced competition of spin, charge and lattice
   degrees of freedom, characteristic for doped manganites.

AB Among the fields in which Russian science can chalk up, of primary
   importance are nanotechnologies involving nanosized-particles-based
   modern materials with preset properties. The specific properties of
   metallic nanoparticles open up wide possibilities of preparing novel
   materials in electronics, effective catalysts, filtering elements,
   biosensors, medications with high biological activity for medical,
   biotechnological, and agricultural applications. Physical chemistry is
   extremely important in the creation of interdisciplinary basic
   foundation of nanochemistry and applied nanotechnology of XXI century
   [1-4]. The methods of synthesis, in inversed micelles, of metallic
   nanoparticles, stable in liquid phase and in nanocomposites and showing
   characteristic bands of optical UV-vis absorption, allow using modern
   physicochemical methods of studying the nanostructure formation,
   properties, and polyfunctional activity [5-10]. The results of the
   studies of adsorption processes of the metal nanosized aggregates in
   solutions, obtained by using chromatography (high-performance liquid
   chromatography, thin-layer chromatography, gas chromatography) and
   demonstrating the important role of active surface centers and
   molecular interactions, may serve as a theoretical basis in producing
   new nanocomposite materials with unique properties [10-12].

   cetyltrimethylammonium layer resulted in moving of pyrene molecules
   away from silver surface and simultaneous disappearance of the silver
   nanoparticles fluorescence band. These data strongly support the recent
   hypothesis of fluorophore-plasmon coupled emission.

AB The crystal structure of thin lead sulfide (PbS) films fabricated by
   hydrochemical deposition is studied by X-ray diffraction analysis. It
   is established that both the synthesized PbS films and the same films
   annealed in the temperature interval of 293-423 K have a cubic (space
   group Fm (3) over bar m) crystal structure different from the B1-type
   structure. In this structure, sulfur (S) atoms are located not only in
   positions 4(b) (octahedral interstices of the face-centered sublattice
   of lead (Pb) atoms) but also in positions 8(c), i.e., in tetrahedral
   interstices. The occupations of positions 4(b) and 8(c) by S atoms are
   similar to 0.84 and similar to 0.08, respectively. Long-range order in
   the location of S atoms in positions of each type is absent, but
   correlations may be present. The new revealed structure of PbS films
   remains stable under a prolonged annealing in the temperature interval
   from 293 to 423 K.

   composition and structural characteristics of Pt/C and Pt (x) -Ni/C
   nanocomposites by variation of the water-organic solvent composition
   was demonstrated. The minimum average size of nanoparticles in
   synthesized metal-carbon materials promising as electrocatalysts in

AB Chitosan, (1-4)-2-amino-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucan, is a deacetylated form
   of chitin, an abundant biodegradable, positively charged natural
   polysaccharide. Chitosan is used for antigen delivery through mucosal
   barrier due to its ability to disrupt tight junctions. Here we produced
   new water-soluble low-molecular weight chitosan (LMW-Chi) lipid
   derivatives and compared their ability to stimulate humoral response
   with the effect of unmodified LMW-Chi or its oligosaccharide
   derivatives. LMW-Chi effectively penetrated into macrophage-like,
   lymphoid and epithelial cells. it also stimulated in mice IgG
   production to model proteins delivered either by subcutaneous or
   intranasal routes. Adjuvant effect of chitosan derivatives was
   comparable to or lower than that of unmodified LMW-Chi. Thus, it is
   possible that adjuvant effect is induced by unmodified glucosamine
   units of chitosan. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB We studied the internal structure of sterically stabilized water- and
   oil-based ferrofluids in the vicinity of the free interface with a gas
   by means of x-ray reflectometry and grazing-incidence x-ray
   diffraction. It was found that in-depth distribution of the magnetic
   nanoparticles in the layer close to the interface is essentially
   inhomogeneous. In the case of water-based ferrofluids an enhanced
   concentration of surfactant and subsequent reduced concentration of the
   particles were detected in the 100-200-A-thick interface-adjacent
   layer. Scattering patterns possessing characteristic features of powder
   diffraction revealed partial ordering of the surfactant in a
   multilamellar structure. External magnetic fields applied perpendicular
   to the interface effectively reduced thickness of the depleted layer
   bringing the particles from the bulk to the surface. However no
   field-induced correlations between the particles were detected. In the
   top 500-A-thick layer of an oil-based ferrofluid depletion of the
   particles density was also present; however, no special arrangement of
   the surfactant molecules was manifested by the experimental data.
   Interestingly, for all samples we observed wavy surface deformation
   appearing in the normal magnetic field of a strength H much smaller
   than the critical values H-c calculated according to the conventional
   theory of ferrofluid surface instability. This deformation with lateral
   periodicity of a few millimeters has an amplitude smoothly increasing
   up to a few microns at H=0.5H(c).

ID RELAXATION-STIMULATED RESONANCES; SINGLE-DOMAIN PARTICLES;
   MOSSBAUER-SPECTRA; FROZEN FERROFLUIDS; MODEL; EXCITATION
AB Experimental evidence and theoretical substantiation are presented for
   the asymptotic behavior of high-temperature magnetization of an
   ensemble of nanoparticles in a weak magnetic field, which was predicted
   earlier and which differs qualitatively from the "Langevin" limit for
   ideal superparamagnetic particles. It is shown that the physical reason
   for the new asymptotic behavior is the temperature-independent
   "positive" tilt of the uniform magnetization vector at local energy
   minima in the direction of the field; this asymptotic behavior is
   associated with the nonstandard thermodynamics of single-domain
   particles, which depends on the ratio of characteristic frequencies of
   regular precession and random diffusion of this vector. An alternative
   approach is proposed for describing the magnetic dynamics of an
   ensemble of nanoparticles in a magnetic field, and the precession
   orbits of the magnetization vector are considered as stochastic states
   of each particle, whereas each state is characterized by the
   trajectory-averaged value of magnetization.

ID LASER-RADIATION; QUANTUM-DOT
AB It is demonstrated that the evolution of the surface relief of the
   stressed elastic nanolayer that interacts with mobile point defects can
   be described using a nonlinear equation similar to the
   Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. The solution to the equation describes
   the threshold (with respect to the defect concentration or the
   mechanical stress) transition to the periodic spatially bent state of
   the layer with the simultaneous generation of spatially periodic defect
   clusters at the extrema of the spontaneously emerging surface relief.
   In this case, the layer deformation corresponds to the displacements in
   the static bending Lamb wave. The self-organizing periodic cellular
   deformation-defect surface structure can serve as a universal seed for
   the subsequent growth of nanoparticles in the processes of laser, ion,
   or electrochemical etching and in molecular beam epitaxy of
   nanostructures.

AB Silver nanoparticles were prepared by reduction of the corresponding
   metal salt with NaBH4 in the presence of appropriate dispersing agents,
   namely, copolymers of maleic acid:
   poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone-alt-maleic acid), poly(ethylene-alt-maleic
   acid), poly(styrene-alt-maleic acid) or their amphyphilic derivatives.
   A thorough study of the whole process of silver nanoparticles
   production including formation of polymeric silver salt and
   stabilization of nanoparticles has been carried out. The degree of
   cooperativity of copolymer silver ions binding process and binding
   capacity of copolymers with respect to silver ions was calculated. To
   estimate the effect of silver binding on dimension of copolymers
   particles in solutions viscometric method and atomic force microscopy
   were used. The most stable and highly silver-"loaded" colloids,
   identified with optical absorption spectroscopy and transmission
   electron microscopy, were prepared at biphilic copolymers
   concentrations lower than their critical aggregation concentrations and
   copolymer/Ag+ molar ratio was equal to unity. Under optimal reduction
   conditions, the final morphology of Ag nanoparticles is governed by
   structural similarity (strict alternation of monomer units) and similar
   polymer chains length of all copolymers; hydrophobic ligands only
   assist in stabilization of nanoparticles. A simple method for
   evaluating the thickness of polymer protective layer based on atomic
   force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy data is proposed.

AB Influence of heterogenization on catalytic properties of block
   copolymer micellar catalysts derived from
   polystyrene-block-poly-4-vinylpyridine and containing Pd monometallic
   and bimetallic PdAu, PdPt, and PdZn nanoparticles has been studied in
   selective hydrogenation of the triple bond of
   3,7-dimethyloctaen-6-yne-1-ol-3 (dehydrolinalool). We demonstrate that
   the heterogenization can both increase and decrease catalytic activity
   depending on the type of NPs. In the absence of a modifying metal (Pd
   monometallic nanoparticles) or for PdZn nanoparticles where Zn is the
   electron donor, the activity of heterogenized catalysts increases,
   while for PdAu and PdPt based catalysts, where the modifying metal is
   the electron acceptor, the activity decreases. These changes are
   explained by the increased polarity of the catalyst after deposition on
   alumina (addition of a component with a higher dielectric constant)
   offset by poor accessibility of some catalytic sites of nanoparticles
   containing electron deficient Pd atoms. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All

AB The nonlinear optical properties of gold nanoparticles dispersed in
   optically transparent matrices Al2O3, ZnO, and SiO2 are investigated
   using the classical and off-axis techniques of the Z-scan method at a
   wavelength of 532 nm (radiation from a nanosecond Nd : YAG laser). The
   experimental data on the nonlinear refraction in composite materials
   are obtained. The nonlinear refractive indices and the light absorption
   coefficients are determined, and the real and imaginary parts of the
   third-order nonlinear susceptibility for the structures under
   investigation are calculated. It is demonstrated that, for the
   composite materials under consideration, the nonlinear properties of
   the medium under the chosen conditions of laser irradiation are
   predominantly determined by the Kerr effect and the contribution of
   this effect exceeds the contribution of the thermal lens.

AB Nickel compounds were deposited on alumina-silica ceramic foam by
   different methods, in particular a homogeneous precipitation and a
   heterogeneous sol-gel processing to prepare catalyst for pyrolysis of
   alkanes (methane, propane-butane). Carbon deposits, in particular
   catalytic filamentous carbon (CFC) were synthesized on the Al/Si
   surface during the catalytic pyrolysis. Comparative analysis of the
   textural parameters of the initial support and composite carbon-mineral
   adsorbents was carried out. The effect of the method of catalyst
   preparation upon the morphology of supported nickel compounds and
   synthesized carbon deposits was examined in scanning electron
   microscope. The carbon yield for catalysts prepared by homogeneous
   precipitation was shown to be an order of magnitude higher than for the
   catalysts prepared by other methods. A uniform distribution of nickel
   nanoparticles deposited on the Al/Si foam by homogeneous precipitation
   led to the formation of a mesoporous CFC-layer with thickness of
   0.5-2.0 mu m and specific surface area ca. 500 m(2)/g due to chaotic
   interlacing of carbon nanofibers with a diameter of 50-100 nm and

AB We report on structural and magnetic properties of granular films
   consisting of 2.5nm Ni nanoparticles. The films are fabricated by the
   original laser electrodispersion technique, which allows producing
   nearly monodisperse and amorphous particles. Atomic force microscopy (
   AFM) study shows that in 8 nm thickness films the particles are
   self-assembled in clusters with the lateral size 100-150nm and the
   height of about 8 nm. Performed by SQUID, the films magnetization
   measurements reveal superparamagnetic behaviour, characteristic for an
   ensemble of non-interacting single domain magnetic particulates. It is
   found that the magnetic moment of the particulate is equal to that of
   about 3000 individual Ni nanoparticles and the blocking temperature is
   close to room temperature. Defined from magnetic measurements, the size
   of single domain particulates correlates well with the size of the
   clusters determined from AFM images. We propose that exchange
   interaction plays an important role in the formation of the
   particulates by aligning the magnetic moments of the individual Ni
   nanoparticles inside the clusters. Presence of magnetic clusters with
   high blocking temperature makes the fabricated films potentially useful
   for high-density magnetic data storage applications. (c) 2008 Elsevier

AB This study aimed to design a panel of uniform particulate biochemical
   reagents and to test them in specific bioassays. These reagents are
   polymer particles of different sizes doped with semiconductor
   nanocrystals and conjugated with either full-size antibodies or
   recombinant mini-antibodies (4D5 scFv fragment) designed by genetic
   engineering approaches. Materials & methods: A panel of highly
   fluorescent polymer particles (150-800 nm) were formed by embedding
   CdSe/ZnS nanocrystals (quantum dots) into preformed polyacrolein and
   poly(acrolein-co-styrene) particles. Morphology, content and
   fluorescence characteristics of the prepared materials were studied by
   laser correlation spectroscopy, spectrophotometry, optical and
   fluorescent microscopy and fluorimetry. Results: The obtained
   fluorescent particles sensitized by anti-Yersinia pestis antibodies
   were used for rapid agglutination glass test suitable for screening
   analysis of Y. pestis antigen and for microtiter particle
   agglutination, which, owing to its speed and simplicity, is very
   beneficial for diagnostic detection of Y. pestis antigen. Recombinant
   4D5 scFv antibodies designed and conjugated with polymer particles
   containing quantum dots provide multipoint highly specific binding with
   cancer marker HER2/neu on the surface of SKOV-3 cell.

TI Ion transport mechanism in hybrid MF-4SC membranes modified by silica

SO RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY

DT Article
ID FIELD GRADIENT NMR; EXCHANGE MEMBRANES; SPECTROSCOPY
AB Transport properties of MF-4SC perfluorinated cation-exchange membrane
   composites containing hydrous silica and phosphotungstic heteropoly
   acid (PTA) nanoparticles were studied at various temperatures.
   Modification of an MF-4SC membrane increases its ion conductivity under
   reduced humidity by 2.5 orders of magnitude compared to the unmodified
   membrane and makes the material less humidity-dependent. Comparison of
   NMR and impedance spectroscopy data implies that water molecules are
   involved in ion transport in the test samples. Most likely that
   modification changes the membrane structure at the nanoscale (broadens
   channels and increases pores) and generates an additional net of
   hydrogen bonds involving a dopant and sulfo groups of the membrane.

AB Background: We posit that cell-mediated drug delivery can improve
   transport of therapeutic enzymes to the brain and decrease inflammation
   and neurodegeneration seen during Parkinson's disease. Our prior works
   demonstrated that macrophages loaded with nanoformulated catalase
   ('nanozyme') then parenterally injected protect the nigrostriatum in a
   murine model of Parkinson's disease. Packaging of catalase into block
   ionomer complex with a synthetic polyelectrolyte block copolymer
   precludes enzyme degradation in macrophages. Methods: We examined
   relationships between the composition and structure of block ionomer
   complexes with a range of block copolymers, their physicochemical
   characteristics, and loading, release and catalase enzymatic activity
   in bone marrow-derived macrophages. Results: Formation of block ionomer
   complexes resulted in improved aggregation stability. Block ionomer
   complexes with epsilon-polylysine and poly(L-glutamic
   acid)-poly(ethylene glycol) demonstrated the least cytotoxicity and
   high loading and release rates. However, these formulations did not
   efficiently protect catalase inside macrophages. Conclusion: Nanozymes
   with polyethyleneimine- and poly(L-lysine)(10)-poly(ethylene glycol)
   provided the best protection of enzymatic activity for cell-mediated
   drug delivery.

AB Au has been loaded (1% wt.) on different commercial oxide supports
   (CuO, La2O3, Y2O3, NiO) by three different methods: double impregnation
   (DIM), liquid-phase reductive deposition (LPRD), and ultrasonication
   (US). Samples were characterised by N-2 adsorption at -196 degrees C,
   high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, selected area
   electron diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry, high-angle
   annular dark-field imaging (Z-contrast), X-ray diffraction, and
   temperature programmed reduction. CO oxidation was used as a test
   reaction to compare the catalytic activities. The best results were
   obtained with Au loaded by DIM on the NiO support, with an activity of
   7.2 x 10(-4) mol(CO).g(Au)(-1).s(-1) at room temperature. This is most
   likely related to the Au nanoparticle size being the smallest in this
   catalyst (average 4.8 nm), since it is well known that gold particle
   size determines the catalytic activity. Other samples, having larger Au
   particle sizes (in the 2-12 nm range, with average sizes ranging from
   4.8 to 6.8 nm), showed lower activities. Nevertheless, all samples
   prepared by DIM had activities (from 1.1 x 10(-4) to 7.2 x 10(-4)
   mol(CO).g(Au)(-1).s(-1), at room temperature) above those reported in
   the literature for gold on similar oxide supports. Therefore, this
   method gives better results than the most usual methods of
   deposition-precipitation or co-precipitation.

AB UV-shielding property, photocatalytic activity and cytotoxicity
   (including photocytotoxicity) of citrate-stabilized ceria colloid
   solutions were studied. It was established that UV-shielding property
   (namely, the sun protection factor, the critical absorption wavelength
   and the UVA/UVB-ratio) of ceria nanoparticles are as good as those of
   titanium dioxide and zinc oxide nanoparticles. It was further
   demonstrated that ceria nanoparticles possesses substantially lower
   photocatalytic activity, which additionally decreases upon decrease in
   ceria particle size. It was found that colloid ceria solutions are
   non-toxic to mouse fibroblasts (L929) and fibroblast-like cells of
   African Green monkey (VERO). Moreover, ceria nanoparticles are capable
   to protect these cells from UV-irradiation-induced damage. It was
   proposed that nanocrystalline ceria could be used not only as
   UV-blocking material, but also as prophylactic and even therapeutic
   compound for sunburns treatment. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB The authors describe a quantitative evaluation of the efficacy of cell
   labeling with plasmon-resonant light-scattering nanoparticles used as
   contrast agents for dark-field microscopy imaging. The experimental
   model is based on the biospecific labeling of pig embryo kidney (SPEV)
   cells with primary phage antibodies, followed by the dark-field
   microscopic visualization using conjugates of silica/gold nanoshells
   with secondary rabbit antiphage antibodies. To quantify nanoparticle
   binding, the authors introduce the labeling-efficacy factor (LEF) which
   is equal to the ratio of the bound-particle pixels per cell to the
   total number of pixels occupied by the cell. The LEF is calculated by
   an imaging-analysis algorithm based on the freely available ImageJ
   Java-based processing code. In terms of the LEF, a distinct difference
   was found between intact, nonspecifically labeled, and biospecifically
   labeled cells.

AB One-dimensional confinement effects are modelled within the hybrid
   HF-DFT LCAO approach considering neutral and single-charged oxygen
   vacancies in SrTiO3 ultrathin films. The calculations reveal that
   confinement effects are surprisingly short-range in this partly
   covalent perovskite; already for film thickness of 2-3 nm (and we
   believe, similar size nanoparticles) only the surface-plane defect
   properties differ from those in the bulk. This includes a pronounced
   decrease of the defect formation energy (by similar to 1 eV), a much
   deeper defect band level and a noticeable change in the electronic
   density redistribution at the near-surface vacancy site with respect to
   that in the bulk. The results also show that the size effect pertains
   to the interactions between the oxygen vacancy and two neighboring
   titanium atoms and orientation (parallel or perpendicular to the
   surface) of the Ti-V-O-Ti complex. In particular, we predict
   considerable oxygen vacancy segregation towards the surface.

AB In this work, the properties of hydroxyapatite (HAP) nanoparticles
   (NPs) have been studied both theoretically and experimentally focusing
   on computational analysis. HAP is widely used to fabricate implants,
   for drug delivery, etc. The physical properties of the nanosized HAP
   particles play an important role in the interaction with cells in the
   human body and are of great interest. Computer simulation was employed
   to understand the properties of HAP clusters (Ca-5(PO4)(3)OH) including
   formation energies, dipole moments and polarization (surface charges)
   by molecular mechanics (MM+, OPLS) and mostly by quantum semi-empirical
   Hartree-Fock (PM3) methods. The size of the simulated cluster is found
   to affect its dipole moment, polarization, and, finally, the electron
   work function-phi. These parameters depend on the concentration of
   hydrogen atoms H (or protons) at the surface. Values of phi were
   experimentally estimated via photoelectron emission measurements. The
   magnitude of phi was demonstrated to have a positive correlation on
   sizes. The NPs demonstrated a capability to be gathered within
   conglomerates. This property is confirmed by the calculated data for
   various sizes. Their sizes have a positive correlation on phi by the
   native particles. The main results show that the distributions of
   dipole moments have very different space orientations (along the OX, OY
   and OZ axes, the OZ axis is oriented along the OH column) and change
   with the addition of hydrogen atoms, which saturate the broken hydrogen
   bonds. This electrical property of NP leads to different behaviors and
   motions with consequent aggregation: (1) for the case of NPs having
   dipole moment oriented preferably perpendicular to the OZ axis (with
   more hydrogen bonds saturated by added H)-the HAP NP aggregates with
   hexagonal orientation and forms a wider and more spherical shape
   (sphere-like or bundle-like); (2) for the case of NPs having dipole
   moment oriented along the OZ axis (as is the case in the absence of
   added protons or non-saturated hydrogen bonds)-the NPs firstly rotated
   and oriented along this axis to form the most elongated cylindrical
   shape (rod-like). S Online supplementary data available from

ID CONTROLLED-RELEASE
AB The clinical outcome of patients with ischemic heart disease can be
   significantly improved with the implementation of targeted drug
   delivery into the ischemic myocardium. In this paper, we present our
   original findings relevant to the problem of therapeutic heart
   targeting with use of nanoparticles. Experimental approaches included
   fabrication of carbon and silica nanoparticles, their characterization
   and surface modification. The acute hemodynamic effects of nanoparticle
   formulation as well as nanoparticle biodistribution were studied in
   male Wistar rats. Carbon and silica nanoparticles are nontoxic
   materials that can be used as carriers for heart-targeted drug
   delivery. Concepts of passive and active targeting can be applied to
   the development of targeted drug delivery to the ischemic myocardial
   cells. Provided that ischemic heart-targeted drug delivery can be
   proved to be safe and efficient, the results of this research may
   contribute to the development of new technologies in the pharmaceutical
   industry.

AB Diabetic neuropathy (DN) is a debilitating disorder occurring in most
   diabetic patients without a viable treatment yet. The present work
   examined the protective effect of Mg-25-PMC16 nanoparticle (porphyrin
   adducts of cyclohexil fullerene-C60) in a rat model of streptozotocin
   (STZ)-induced DN. Mg-25-PMC16 (0.5 lethal dose(50) [LD50]) was
   administered intravenously in two consecutive days before
   intraperitoneal injection of STZ (45 mg/kg). Mg-24-PMC16 and MgCl2 were
   used as controls. Blood 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG), oxidative
   stress biomarkers, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level in dorsal root
   ganglion (DRG) neurons were determined as biomarkers of DN. Results
   indicated that 2,3-DPG and ATP decreased whereas oxidative stress
   increased by induction of DN which all were improved in
   Mg-25-PMC16-treated animals. No significant changes were observed by
   administration of Mg-24-PMC16 or MgCl2 in DN rats. It is concluded that
   in DN, oxidative stress initiates injuries to DRG neurons that finally
   results in death of neurons whereas administration of Mg-25-PMC16 by
   release of Mg and increasing ATP acts protectively.

AB We report on the synthesis and optical and structural characterization
   of ultrasmall (<2 nm) CdS nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution
   of 10% prepared in aqueous and alcohol solutions of polyethyleneimine
   (PEI). The PEI-stabilized CdS nanoparticles reveal a structured
   absorption band with the first excitonic maximum at 3.5 eV and
   broad-band photoluminescence with quantum yields of 12-14% in water,
   18-20% in ethanol (80 vol%), and up to 60-70% in solid PEI films at
   room temperature. The nature of the photoluminescence was studied by
   using the time- and wavelength-dependent emission measurements. The
   role of precursor cadmium(II)-PEI complex in the formation of uniform
   and ultrasmall luminescent CdS nanoparticles, as well as the dynamic
   emission quenching by water, are discussed. A study of the
   photochemical properties of PEI-stabilized CdS nanoparticles both under
   continuous and nanosecond pulse illumination showed excellent stability
   of solid PEI films incorporating CdS nanoparticles toward UV
   illumination and reductive character of the CdS nanoparticle
   photocorrosion in aqueous solutions.

AB Light-absorbing endogenous cellular proteins, in particular cytochrome
   c, are used as intrinsic biomarkers for studies of cell biology and
   environment impacts. To sense cytochrome c against real biological
   backgrounds, we combined photothermal (PT) thermal-lens single-channel
   schematic in a back-synchronized measurement mode and a multiplex
   thermal-lens schematic in a transient high resolution (ca. 350 nm)
   imaging mode. These multifunctional PT techniques using continuous-wave
   (cw) Ar+ laser and a nanosecond pulsed optical parametric oscillator in
   the visible range demonstrated the capability for label-free spectral
   identification and quantification of trace amounts of cytochrome c in a
   single mitochondrion alone or within a single live cell. PT imaging
   data were verified in parallel by molecular targeting and fluorescent
   imaging of cellular cytochrome c. The detection limit of cytochrome c
   in a cw mode was 5 x 10(-9) mol/L (80 attomols in the signal-generation
   zone); that is ca. 10(3) lower than conventional absorption
   spectroscopy. Pulsed fast PT microscopy provided the detection limit
   for cytochrome c at the level of 13 zmol (13 x 10(-21) mol) in the
   ultrasmall irradiated volumes limited by optical diffraction effects.
   For the first time, we demonstrate a combination of high resolution PT
   imaging with PT spectral identification and ultrasensitive quantitative
   PT characterization of cytochrome c within individual mitochondria in
   single live cells. A potential of far-field PT microscopy to
   sub-zeptomol detection thresholds, resolution beyond diffraction limit,
   PT Raman spectroscopy, and 3D imaging are further highlighted.

AB The problem of batch-to-batch variation of electronic properties and
   purity of conjugated polymers used as electron donor and photon
   harvesting materials in organic solar cells is addressed. A simple
   method is developed for rapid analysis of electronic quality of
   polymer-based materials. It is shown that appearance of impurities
   capable of charge trapping changes electrophysical properties of
   conjugated polymers. In particular, a clear correlation between the
   effective relaxation time tau(eff) and relative photovoltaic
   performance (eta/eta(max)) is revealed for samples of
   poly(3-hexylthiophene) intentionally polluted with a palladium
   catalyst. This dependence is also valid for all other investigated
   samples of conjugated polymers. Therefore, fast impedance measurements
   at three different frequencies allow one to draw conclusions about the
   purity of the analyzed polymer sample and even estimate its
   photovoltaic performance. The developed method might find extensive
   applications as a simple tool for product quality control in the
   laboratory and industrial-scale production of conjugated polymers for
   electronic applications.

AB The dynamics of the radiative recombination of charge carriers in CdS
   nanoparticles stabilized in aqueous solutions of polyethyleneimine was
   studied. It was shown that decay of the photoluminescence of the
   nanoparticles is characterized by a set of time constants in the range
   of 10(-1) -10(2) ns, while its rate depends on the energy of the
   radiation quanta. This relationship is interpreted as the result of
   competition between the processes of radiative recombination and
   vibrational dissipation of the excitation energy.

AB Ba-137 NMR spectroscopy is very suitable to study size effects in very

   155 and 15 nm. The NMR measurements were carried out within a
   temperature range of 295 to 420 K covering also the cubic to tetragonal
   phase transition at T-C. Below T-C the NMR line shape was explained by
   a superposition of two contributions the relative fractions of which
   were analyzed over a wider temperature range. Assuming the core-shell
   model the thickness of the outer shell was estimated. The shell
   thickness strongly decreased with decreasing particle size. The
   applicability of other structural models was also discussed.

AB We studied the dependence of absorption and fluorescence spectra of
   complexes of Al, In, Sc, Y, and La with dibenzoylmethane and
   naphthoyltrifluoroacetone, as well as the dependence of sensitized
   fluorescence of dyes in nanoparticles of these complexes, in relation
   to the water pH, the ratio between ions and diketones, and the ion
   selection. We showed that the ability of complexes of ions to form
   nanoparticles that efficiently sensitize dye molecules incorporated
   into them is determined by stability constants of these ions with
   organic ligands and by their ability to compete with the formation of
   hydroxy complexes of these ions. We found that nanoparticles consist of
   diketonates of different compositions and that Nile red incorporated
   into nanoparticles is an indicator of the dependence of the composition
   of nanoparticles on the selection of the central ion of complexes and
   conditions of their formation. We revealed that complexes
   M(diketone)(OH)(2) self-assemble into nanoparticles with an admixture
   of dye molecules and efficiently sensitize dyes upon excitation into
   absorption bands of complexes. We showed that, at concentrations of
   rhodamine 6G in water smaller than 50 nM, the use of a solution that
   contains 50 mu M of Al(III), In(III), or Sc(III) + 50 mu M of
   naphthoyltrifluoroacetone makes it possible to increase the sensitivity
   of the luminescence analysis by 20-fold for the presence of rhodamine
   6G in an aqueous solution.

AB Aggregation, catalytic activity, and the influence of alkylated
   p-sulfonatocalix[n]arenes (SCA; n = 4, 6, 8) on the energy exchange in
   cells of wheat roots were studied. In water SCA are surfactants, and
   their efficiency changes with an increase in the number of aromatic
   rings (n) and the length of hydrocarbon substituents (R) in the
   molecule. In the range of critical micelle concentration, SCA form
   micelles with an effective hydrodynamic diameter of similar to 200 nm.
   The catalytic activity of micellar solutions of SCA (n = 4, 8; R =
   C12H25) in hydrolysis of ethyl 4-nitrophenyl chloromethylphosphonate
   (ENCP) decreases with an increase in n, whereas the binding constant of
   ENCP increases. The modifying effect of SCA on the membranes and the
   energy exchange in cells of wheat roots was revealed: the
   membranotropic activity of SCA increases with an increase in the
   hydrophobicity of substituents R and the macrocycle size.

AB The effect of thermal noise at 300 K on the reversal of a single-domain
   uniaxial magnetic nanoparticle is studied on the basis of computer
   simulation of the Landau-Lifshits equation. It is demonstrated that the
   decrease in the particle size can lead to the increase in the mean
   reversal time up to two times due to the noise delayed switching
   effect. This negative effect can be suppressed by the proper choice of
   the angle between the reversal magnetic field and the anisotropy axis.
   The minimal volume of a nanoparticle that provides the reliable process
   of switching, is found for certain values of the reversal magnetic
   field angles. It is demonstrated that the sensible choice of the
   reversal magnetic field angle allows to use much smaller particles
   without degradation of the switching reliability.

AB Single-wall carbon nanotubes modified by anionic polyelectrolyte
   molecules are embedded into the shells of microcapsules. Carbon
   nanotubes serve as rigid rods in a softer polymeric capsule, which
   forms a free-standing shell upon treatment with glutaraldehyde and
   subsequent drying. The embedded carbon nanotubes exhibit a broad
   absorption in the UV-near-infrared part of the spectrum, and that
   allows point-wise activation and opening of the microcapsules by laser.
   Raman signal analysis shows changes of carbon-nanotube-specific lines
   after high-power laser irradiation, which is characteristic of the
   formation of disordered carbonlike structures. These
   polyelectrolyte/carbon nanotube composite capsules represent a novel
   light-addressable type of microcontainers.

   The particle size distribution, morphology, and features of the

   (PTCDI) was studied by means of photoelectrical and spectroscopic
   methods. Films consisting of smooth 100 mol% layers of P-F and PTCDI
   were prepared by the Langmuir-Schafer (LS) technique and thermal
   evaporation, respectively. The time-resolved Maxwell displacement
   charge (TRMDC) and laser flash-photolysis methods were utilized to
   demonstrate photoinduced ET from P-F to PTCDI regardless of which
   chromophore is photoexcited. Finally, the information about the
   electron movement in the respective thin films was used to build a
   layered organic solar cell, whose internal quantum yield (Phi(I)) of
   collected charges was 13%.

AB Coadsorption of electrolyte ions can have a marked influence on the
   adsorption and hence interfacial reactivity of multicharged ions but
   has generally been overlooked in previous density functional theory
   (DFT) studies. The impact of this effect is demonstrated for the
   DFT-based interpretation of in situ FTIR spectra of the controversial
   binding form of weakly adsorbed carbonate on hydrated hematite
   nanoparticles and ferrihydrite. Using a new methodology, we show that
   addition of hydronium or sodium ions in the DFT models leads to
   assigning the weakly adsorbed carbonate to an inner-sphere monodentate
   mononuclear complex. FTIR data and the "bond length-vibrational
   frequency" correlations established by DFT suggest that the adsorption
   affinity of ferrihydrite toward carbonate is lower than that of 7 nm
   hematite NPs. As opposed to the case of carbonate, the outer-sphere
   adsorption form of sulfate is demonstrated to be stable in the presence
   of hydronium. These findings have important implications for DFT
   modeling of the solid-water interfaces, which has become a major
   complementary tool to interpret spectroscopic and macroscopic
   observations of adsorption phenomena.

AB A new class of colloid structures, celloidosomes, has been developed
   which represent hollow microcapsules whose membranes consist of a
   single monolayer of living cells. Two routes for producing these
   structures were designed based on templating of: (i) air bubbles and
   (ii) anisotropic microcrystals of calcium carbonate with living cells,
   which allowed us to fabricate celloidosomes of spherical, rhombohedral
   and needle-like morphologies. Air microbubbles were templated by yeast
   cells coated with poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH), then coated
   with carboxymethylcellulose and rehydrated resulting in the formation
   of spherical multicellular structures. Similarly, calcium carbonate
   microcrystals of anisotropic shapes were coated with several
   consecutive layers of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes to obtain a
   positive surface charge which was used to immobilise yeast cells coated
   with anionic polyelectrolyte of their surfaces. After dissolving of
   sacrificial cores, hollow multicellular structures were obtained. The
   viability of the cells in the produced structures was confirmed by
   using fluorescein diacetate. In order to optimize the separation of
   celloidosomes from free cells magnetic nanoparticles were immobilised
   onto the surface of templates prior to the cells deposition, which
   greatly facilitated the separation using a permanent magnet. Two
   alternative approaches were developed to form celloidosome structures
   using magnetically functionalised core-shell microparticles which
   resulted in the formation of celloidosomes with needle-like and
   cubic-like geometries which follows the original morphology of the
   calcium carbonate microcrystals. Our methods for fabrication of
   celloidosomes may found applications in the development of novel
   symbiotic bio-structures, artificial multicellular organisms and in
   tissue engineering. The unusual structure of celloidosomes resembles
   the primitive forms of multicellular species, like Volvox, and other

AB Raman signals from molecules adsorbed on a noble metal surface are
   enhanced by many orders of magnitude due to the plasmon resonances of
   the substrate. Additionally, the enhanced spectra are modified compared
   to the spectra of neat molecules; many vibrational frequencies are
   shifted, and relative intensities undergo significant changes upon
   attachment to the metal. With the goal of devising an effective scheme
   for separating the electromagnetic and chemical effects, we explore the
   origin of the Raman spectra modification of benzenethiol adsorbed on
   nanostructured gold surfaces. The spectral modifications are attributed
   to the frequency dependence of the electromagnetic enhancement and to
   the effect of chemical binding. The latter contribution can be
   reproduced computationally using molecule-metal cluster models. We
   present evidence that the effect of chemical binding is mostly due to
   changes in the electronic structure of the molecule rather than to the
   fixed orientation of molecules relative to the substrate.

AB Copper nanoparticles have been found to be catalysts for both
   homogeneous (stabilized by oligoethyleneglycols) and heterogeneous
   (immobilized on SiO2) hydroxylation of phenol by hydrogen peroxide to
   dihydroxybenzenes. The catalysts were synthesized in
   oligoethyleneglycols by the reduction of coppersalts (supported or
   nonsupported) using hydrazine. For non-immobilized Cu-nanoparticles
   high selectivities on dihydroxybenzenes were reached at the conversion
   of phenol 32% for 30 min at 40 degrees C. It has been demonstrated that
   adding oxyethylated surfactants to non-immobilized nanoparticles during
   reaction increased selectivity for the ortho-product. Immobilized
   Cu-nanoparticles allowed to achieve the conversion of 69% for 15 min at
   70 degrees C with selectivity on dihydroxybenzenes more than 95%. (c)

AB This paper reports on a theoretical and experimental investigation of
   the behavior of the electrical and thermal conductivities of a
   nanostructured material based on Bi (x) Sb2 - x Te-3 solid solutions.
   The effect of boundary scattering has been taken into account by
   introducing the scattering mechanism with a constant mean free path
   equal to the nanoparticle size. A comparison with the results of the
   measurements has demonstrated that one can describe satisfactorily the
   experimental dependences of the electrical and thermal conductivities
   on the nanoparticle size by using only the parameters of the initial
   solid solution and its pure constituents. The estimates have revealed
   that the lattice thermal conductivity of nanostructured materials can
   be reduced by 20-30% as compared to the initial solid solution with
   nanoparticle sizes of the order of 20 nm, which should produce a
   favorable effect on the magnitude of the thermoelectric figure-of-merit.

AB The investigation of oxidized silver nanoparticles by the photoemission
   (XPS, UPS) and HRTEM methods was performed. The nanoparticles of
   oxidized silver were obtained in the vacuum chamber by two methods of
   synthesis: thermal evaporation of silver nanoparticles followed by
   transferring in convective gas flow and sputtering of oxidized clusters
   under the action of plasma. Both methods indicated that oxygen
   interaction with silver nanoparticles depends strongly on its size. It
   was shown that the chemical bonding of oxygen species stabilized on
   small particles differs from the oxygen species adsorbed on bulk silver
   surfaces (monocrystals, foils and large particles). The low charged
   oxygen with molecular type of bonding stabilizes on particles of size
   approximately 5 nm and smaller. Increasing particle size leads to the
   dissociation of molecular oxygen species and the formation of strongly
   charged oxygen composed of oxide nanoparticles like Ag2O or AgO type.
   The presence of extended defects in the microdomain large nanoparticles
   facilitates the formation of Ag2O or AgO layers covering metallic
   nanosilver. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Spherical silicon nanoparticles were prepared by laser ablation of a
   single crystal Si wafer immersed in 95% ethanol with a pulse duration
   shorter than the time of electron-phonon relaxation (from 35 to 900
   fs). The size distribution depends on the pulse duration as well as the
   width of the size distribution, which increases with the increase of
   the laser pulse duration. High resolution transmission electron
   microscopy performed on 20-40 nm particles showed polycrystalline
   particles made up mainly of silicon (alpha-Si) crystallites with the
   diamond structure and in some cases cubic silicon carbide (SiC)
   inclusions. Electron energy loss spectroscopy data on the large
   particles are very similar to bulk Si. Raman analysis extended to small
   frequencies showed a downshift and an asymmetrical broadening of the
   first-order Si optical peak with respect to bulk Si in good agreement
   with a spatial confinement in 5-10 nm crystallites. The
   photoluminescence spectra present a maximum of emission band at about

ID OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; PARTICLES
AB The Purcell effect, acceleration of a spontaneous emission
   recombination rate, has been observed in InN/In nanocomposites with
   buried nanoparticles of metallic In. This effect, associated with
   localized plasmons, is characterized by the averaged Purcell factor as
   high as 30-40 in the structures with large enough particles. This high
   value is indicative of a noticeable contribution from the emitting
   dipoles polarized normally to the nanoparticle surface in this system.
   The experimental observation of shortening of the emission lifetimes
   with increasing the amount of In is supported by calculations performed
   in a semiclassical approximation.

AB The catalysts Rh/Al2O3 and Rh/TiO2 for hydrogen production from NaBH4
   were prepared by deposition technique from RhCl3 reduced by NaBH4 and
   were studied by XPS and TEM. It was found that the RhCl3/Al2O3 system
   is more stable comparing to RhCl3/TiO2 which starts to decompose by
   weak heat treatment. It was shown that NaBH4 reduced RhCl3/TiO2 (Al2O3)
   to supported metal Rh nanoparticles in both cases. In the case of
   Rh/TiO2 SMSI effect it was found after RT reduction. The SMSI (Strong
   Metal-Support Interaction) effect gave an explanation for the
   difference of activity between Rh/TiO2 and Rh/Al2O3 catalysts in

AB The results of electron magnetic resonance (EMR) and magnetization
   measurements of Co-implanted barium titanate (BaTiO3) perovskite
   crystal are presented. It has been revealed that the implantation with
   Co on different fluencies of metal concentrations produces a granular
   composite film in the surface layer of BaTiO3 substrate, which exhibits
   remarkable ferromagnetic behavior. EMR measurements revealed spectra
   originated from iron impurities of BaTiO3 substrate. Ferromagnetic
   resonance spectra from Co-implanted surface layer, exhibiting an
   out-of-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy, were also observed. The
   magnetization measurements performed in various geometries show that
   the ferromagnetic Co:BaTiO3 system displays easy-plane magnetic
   anisotropy. It has been shown that the magnetization and coercivity of
   ferromagnetic state depends on the fluence of implantation. The
   observed phenomena are discussed on the basis of strong magnetic
   dipolar interaction between Co nanoparticles inside the granular
   composite film formed as a result of implantation.

AB Resveratrol is a substance of plant origin with antioxidant,
   anti-inflammatory, and chemoprotective properties used as a
   biologically active supplement in the prophylaxis of myocardial
   infarction, types 1 and 2 diabetes, and tumors. The aim of the present
   work was to develop and perform pharmacokinetic studies of a nanosomal
   form of resveratrol. The techniques described here yield particles of
   submicron size, with resveratrol yields of 70-100% and resveratrol
   contents in lyophilized formulations reaching 15-20%. After oral
   administration of unmodified resveratrol to mice, only 19% of the dose
   was taken up into the blood, while use of nanosomal resveratrol
   formulations based on Eudragit RL and lecithin/chitosan increased
   bioavailability to 39% and 61% respectively. Increases in the peak
   plasma resveratrol concentration by factors of 4-5 were also seen in
   mice given nanoparticles. Thus, conversion of resveratrol to the
   nanosomal form leads to solubilization and resultant increases in
   absorption into the bloodstream.

AB The magnetic properties of bimagnetic core/shell nanoparticles
   consisting of an antiferromagnetic MnO core and a ferrimagnetic
   passivation shell have been investigated. It is found that the phase of
   the passivation shell (gamma-Mn2O3 or Mn3O4) depends on the size of the
   nanoparticles. Structural and magnetic characterizations concur that
   while the smallest nanoparticles have a predominantly gamma-Mn2O3
   shell, larger ones have increasing amounts of Mn3O4. A considerable
   enhancement of the Neel temperature, T-N, and the magnetic anisotropy
   of the MnO core for decreasing core sizes has been observed. The size
   reduction also leads to other phenomena such as persistent magnetic
   moment in MnO up to high temperatures and an unusual temperature
   behavior of the magnetic domains.

AB The development of new and simple green chemical methods for
   synthesizing colloidal solutions of functional nanoparticles is
   desirable for environment-friendly applications. In the present work,
   we report a feasible method for synthesizing colloidal solutions of
   silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) based on the modified Tollens technique.
   The Ag NPs were stabilized by using oleic acid as a surfactant and were
   produced for the first time by the reduction of silver ammonium complex
   [Ag(NH3)(2)](+)((aq)) by glucose with UV irradiation treatment. A
   stable and nearly monodisperse aqueous Ag NPs solution with
   average-sized particles (similar to 9-10 nm) was obtained. The Ag NPs
   exhibited high antibacterial activity against both Gram-negative
   Escherichia Coll (E. coil) and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus
   bacteria. Electron microscopic images and analyses provided further
   insights into the interaction and bactericidal mechanism of the Ag NPs.
   The proposed method of synthesis is an effective way to produce highly
   bactericidal colloidal solutions for medical, microbiological, and
   industrial applications. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Interfacial interactions, chain dynamics, and glass and melting
   transitions were studied in well-defined core shell nanoparticles with
   amorphous silica or crystalline alumina cores and noncrystallizable
   poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) or crystallizable poly(ethylene glycol)
   (PEG) shells. Varying particle composition caused regular changes in
   the shell thickness from 1 to 2 nm (monomolecular layer) up to 90 nm.
   Far- and mid-IR spectroscopy allowed us to register hydrogen bonding
   and, tentatively, Lewis/Bronsted (LB) interfacial interactions as well
   as changes in the dynamics and conformational state of the polymer
   chains as a function of the nanoshell thickness. Their most pronounced
   peculiarities were found for the monomolecular polymer layers. The LB
   interactions were stronger with the alumina substrate than silica. DSC
   analysis was performed, and the data obtained were in agreement with
   the spectroscopic data. Unlike the bulk polymer, the PVP monolayer was
   characterized with an extraordinarily large dynamic heterogeneity
   within the glass transition while broadening the transition range and
   varying the activation energy by an order of magnitude. The PEG
   monolayer adsorbed on silica was to amorphous, whereas it highly
   crystalline one with the it thin lamellae, down to 3 nm thick, was
   adsorbed on an alumina surface, presumably as a result of the
   quasi-heteroepitaxial crystallization process.

   [Mo6Br8F6](2-) cluster units within the pores of the mesoporous
   chromium carboxylate MIL-101 (MIL stand for Materials from Institut

   analysis, elemental analysis, solid-state NMR. and infrared
   spectroscopy have evidenced the successful loading of the cluster. In a
   second step, the hydrogen sorption properties of the model cluster
   loaded metal organic framework (MOF) system have been analyzed and
   compared to those of the pure MOF sample, through a combination of
   adsorption isotherms (77 K, room temperature), thermal desorption
   spectroscopy, and calorimetry (calculated and experimental) in order to
   evaluate the hydrogen storage efficiency of the cluster loading.

AB Interactions between multivalent preparations of antibodies (conjugated
   with colloidal gold nanoparticles (GNP) as a carrier system) and a
   multivalent ligand were investigated. The aim of the present study was
   to reveal the relationship between the affinity of the conjugate and
   its composition (i.e., the valency). Surface plasmon resonance was
   applied to study the affinity and the kinetics of the interaction of
   multivalent conjugates and multivalent virus (on the example of the
   plum pox virus (PPV)). Three monoclonal antibodies against PPV were
   prepared. Five GNP preparations with an average particle size in the
   range from 5 to 60 nm (according to electron microscopy measurements)
   were obtained. The series of preparations allowed us to synthesize
   GNP-antibody conjugates with different surface areas for immobilization
   of antibodies, and, consequently, conjugates with different valencies.
   It was shown that the affinity of the conjugates changes with size of
   colloidal carriers (i.e. with the valency of the conjugates). The
   affinity of the virus-antibody interaction (antibodies with affinities
   of 1.46 . 10(-8) M and 1.73 . 10(-8) M) is one to three orders of
   magnitude lower (depending on the valency of the conjugate) compared to
   that of the interactions of the virus with GNP conjugates (conjugates
   with the affinity varying from 1.69 . 10(-9) to 7.02 . 10(-12) M and
   from 2.39 . 10(-9) to 2.62 . 10(-11) M, respectively). An increase in
   the conjugate size leads to an increase in its affinity. The similar
   trends were observed for the potato virus X. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Pt-Co/C electrocatalysts with Pt loadings close to 30 wt.% prepared by
   the impregnation method in water ethylene glycol solutions were
   investigated by X-ray diffraction and correlated with electrochemical
   measurements. We show that composition of the binary solvent controls
   the average particle size and its distribution. The unit cell parameter
   of the Pt3Co alloy decreases nonlinearly with decreasing particle size.
   The ORR activity of the prepared Pt-Co/C catalysts in H2SO4 solution
   enhances with decreasing particle size and unit cell parameter as well
   as with narrowing of the particle size distribution. Corrosion
   treatment of the synthesized Pt-Co/C materials brings about an increase
   of ca. 1 nm in the average grain size accompanied by broadening of the
   grain size distribution and a decrease in the Co content. All of the
   synthesized Pt-Co/C materials show higher ORR activities compared with

AB One-dimensional silver halide crystals were grown within single-walled
   nanotube (SWCNT) channels from the melt using a "molten media method".
   Atomic structures of the AgX@SWCNT hybrids were proposed based on
   high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images. It was found
   that AgCl intercalation results in amorphous filling of the SWCNT
   channels. 1D AgBr and AgI crystals intercalated into 1.34 nm SWCNTs
   possess the structure of a two-layer hcp of halogen atoms arranged
   laterally with respect to the SWCNT axis. Electronic properties and
   chemical bonding in AgX@SWCNTs have been investigated by
   high-resolution X-ray photoelectron and near edge X-ray absorption fine
   structure spectroscopy (BESSY, Germany), optical absorption and Raman
   spectroscopy. Optical absorption spectroscopy indicates disappearance
   of E-11(S) transitions between van-Hove singularities, which is caused
   by an effective electron exchange between AgX and the SWCNT. C 1s X-ray
   absorption spectra indicate a new empty level (S1) induced by charge
   transfer. Multi-component structure of photoemission spectra can be
   explained both by the variation of the work function of AgX@SWCNT
   hybrids and local interactions between halogen ions and carbon atoms.
   Raman spectroscopy performed under electrochemical charging clearly and
   directly demonstrated the acceptor behavior of AgX with respect to
   SWCNTs. Based on a whole dataset, a self-consistent picture of the
   AgX-SWCNT interactions is derived. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Unlike macroscopic objects, clusters and nanoparticles lack a definite
   melting temperature at a given pressure but rather have their solid and
   liquid phases coexistent in a certain temperature range and their
   melting temperature dependent on the particle size. As the particle
   size decreases, the melting temperature becomes fundamentally difficult
   to define. This review examines methods for measuring the melting
   temperature and the heat of melting of clusters and nanoparticles. The
   temperature (internal energy) of the particles is defined and how it
   affects the properties of and processes involving the particles is
   discussed. The melting features of clusters and nanoparticles versus
   bulk materials are examined. Early methods of determining the melting
   temperature of large clusters are described. New precision methods of
   measuring the melting temperature and the heat of melting of clusters
   are discussed, which use the clusters themselves as 'high-sensitivity
   calorimeters' to measure energy. Laser-based nanoparticle melting
   techniques are outlined.

AB A temperature measurement technique using SF6 molecules as tiny probe
   thermometers is described, and results are presented, for large
   (CO2)(N) van der Waals clusters (with N >= 10(2)) in a cluster beam.
   The SF6 molecules captured by (CO2)(N) clusters in crossed cluster and
   molecular beams sublimate (evaporate) after a certain time, carrying
   information about the cluster velocity and internal temperature.
   Experiments are performed using detection of these molecules with an
   uncooled pyroelectric detector and infrared multiphoton excitation. The
   multiphoton absorption spectra of molecules sublimating from clusters
   are compared with the IR multiphoton absorption spectra of SF6 in the
   incoming beam. As a result, the nanoparticle temperature in the
   (CO2)(N) cluster beam is estimated as T-cl < 150 K. Time-of-flight
   measurements using a pyroelectric detector and a pulsed CO2 laser are
   performed to determine the velocity (kinetic energy) of SF6 molecules
   sublimating from clusters, and the cluster temperature is found to be
   T-cl = 105 +/- 15 K. The effects of various factors on the results of
   nanoparticle temperature measurements are analyzed. The potential use
   of the proposed technique for vibrational cooling of molecules to low
   temperatures is discussed.

   in aqueous organic media and may include high content of metal ions;
   concentration of ions is easy to vary in such polymeric systems.
   Reduction of metal ions is a common method for obtaining nanoparticles.
   Interpolyelectrolyte complexes reveal high permeability for polar
   low-molecular substances and salts. Such swelling behavior is important
   for the reduction of metal ions included in these solids. The
   properties of triple interpolyelectrolyte-metal complexes and
   preparation of nanocomposites from these materials using various
   methods of metal ion reduction are discussed in this work. (C) 2009

AB Nanocomposites comprising metallic nanoparticles (MNPs) inside a
   semiconductor matrix are promising materials for plasmonics suggesting
   a new concept of light manipulation and generation. Optical properties
   of the nanocomposites are controlled by localized plasmons (Mie
   resonances) in the MNPs. The basic properties of the nanocomposites
   have been studied using InN/In with In clusters formed both
   spontaneously and by the periodic deposition of In insertions. In the
   specially designed nanocomposites, the spots of intense
   cathodoluminescence are strongly correlated with the agglomerations of
   the In MNPs due to plasmon-induced enhancement. Furthermore, a strong
   difference is discovered between the onsets of thermally detected
   absorption and photocurrent. This feature is a key to distinguish
   InN/In from pure InN. To simulate the plasmonic effects in the
   nanocomposites a model has been proposed, which considers the clusters
   as spheroids of random shapes and orientations. The calculated
   dependences are in reasonable agreement with obtained optical data. (C)

AB Structural and energy characteristics of the smallest magnetic
   endofullerene Fe@C-20 were calculated using the density functional
   theory. The ground state of Fe@C-20 was found to be a septet state, and
   the magnetic moment of Fe@C-20 was estimated to be 8 Bohr magnetons.
   The characteristics of an (8,8) carbon nanotube with a single Fe@C-20
   inside were studied with a semiempirical approach. The scheme of a
   magnetic nanorelay based on cantilevered nanotubes filled with magnetic
   endofullerenes was examined. This nanorelay is turned on as a result of
   bending of nanotubes by a magnetic force. The operational
   characteristics of such a nanorelay based on (8,8) and (21,21)
   nanotubes fully filled with Fe@C-20 were estimated and compared to the
   ones of a nanorelay made of a (21,21) nanotube fully filled with
   experimentally observed (Ho3N)@C-80 with the magnetic moment of 21 Bohr
   magnetons. The room-temperature operation of (21,21) nanotube-based
   nanorelays was demonstrated.

AB The properties of gold and silver nanorods and nanodisks with geometric
   parameters typical of wet chemical fabrication protocols were
   investigated. With an extended-precision T-matrix code, a
   representative set of simulations for extinction, light scattering, and
   depolarization ratio spectra of randomly oriented particles and for
   dichroism and birefringence spectra of particles with an arbitrary
   predominant orientation with respect to incident linearly polarized
   light were obtained. The appearance of ultra-depolarized light
   scattering from random ensembles was elucidated by several 3D maps
   illustrating the dependence of the depolarization ratio on particular
   orientations of rods and disks. A simple dipole model sufficed to
   explain the orientation dependence of dichroism and birefringence and
   the unusual invariant spectral localization of the depolarization ratio
   maxima. Reasonable agreement was obtained with experimental data on
   depolarized light scattering from gold nanorods.

AB It has been previously found that in a PCR with yeast genomic DNA as a
   template, microparticles of condensed DNA are formed in the presence of
   KlenTaq polymerase. In the present work, the study of these
   microparticles was continued using electron microscopy. It was shown
   that along with standard electrondense microspheres, microspheres of a
   low electron density with numerous thorns or without any thorns are
   formed. Various types of nanoparticles were detected in the samples:
   nanowires, dot-like electron-absorbing particles (nanodots), and
   compact nanoparticles (nanoscales) of different shape and size. It was
   found that increasing the number of PCR cycles above the optimum leads
   to an abrupt rise in the amount of nanoparticles in the PCR mixture.
   Suspensions of microparticles after quick (5 min) heating at 94A
   degrees C were examined. The partial melting of the microspheres in the
   heated samples was established: they lost part of the DNA and decreased
   in size; simultaneously, abundant clusters of nanowires appeared. The
   effect of nuclease S1 on the DNA of microspheres was studied. The
   molecular mechanisms of the formation of micro- and nanoparticles are
   discussed.

AB Amphiphilic poly-N-vinylpyrrolidone derivatives (Amph-PVP) with
   different molecular weight of hydrophilic PVP fragment and one terminal
   hydrophobic n-alkyl fragment of different length were synthesized for
   preparation of nano-scaled particles in aqueous media. To estimate
   novel polymer efficiency and perspective as basis for drug delivery
   systems, the polymeric micelle-like particles were prepared by dialysis
   and solvent evaporation methods. Indomethacin was incorporated into
   hydrophobic inner core of these nanoparticles as a typical model drug.
   From the dynamic light-scattering measurements, the size of particles
   formed was less than 200 nm with narrow monodisperse size distribution
   and nanoparticles size slightly increased with the amount of
   indomethacin encapsulated into inner core of Amph-PVP particles. The
   critical aggregation concentration values for prepared polymer samples
   determined by fluorescence spectroscopy were in micromole range which
   is lower than it is for common low molecular weight surfactants. As the
   hydrophobic fragment of amphiphilic polymer increased, the critical
   aggregation concentration values decreased. An increase of polymer
   hydrophilic fragment molecular weight produced larger nanoaggregates.
   In vitro release experiments using indomethacin-loaded Amph-PVP
   nanoparticles exhibited the sustained release behavior without any
   burst effect for most polymer samples.

AB We analyse the kinetics of hydriding of metal nanoparticles in the

   the hydride shell. Our treatment is focused on the role of lattice
   strain related to the misfit of the hydride and metal structures. In
   the absence of strain, the kinetics exhibits an initial fast stage
   followed by slowdown. Depending on the relative contribution of strain
   to the H-metal interaction in the ground and activated states for
   diffusion, the initial fast stage of the kinetics is either nearly not
   manifested or becomes shorter and occurs up to somewhat higher

   computations. Unfortunately, simulation of adsorption on heterogeneous
   surfaces within this model is rather complicated due to a large variety
   of available adsorption site types. We propose the combined model with
   lattice representation of adsorbent atoms and arbitrary location of
   adsorbate atoms. Using this model simulation of CO adsorption on
   supported Pt nanoparticles has been performed. With the proposed
   approach the above-mentioned difficulties were successfully overcome.

AB By the method of chemical condensation a stable aqueous colloidal
   solution of nanoparticles of cadmium sulfide was obtained. The solution
   obtained in the daylight had a bright lemon-yellow color. For the
   temporary stabilization of the solution was used an organic complexone,
   disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA), that prevented coagulation
   of colloidal particles up to several months at 4A degrees C. At room
   temperature, the solution remained stable during a month. The structure
   and properties of the disperse phase were studied by the X-ray
   diffraction, optical fluorescence, and electron microscopy. The solid
   particles size is about 3 nm, they have a disordered close-packed
   structure with the space group P6mm and possess the photoluminescence
   color from green to orange depending on the duration of keeping the
   solution. The size of coagulates was 10 nm, 100 nm, and 1 mu m after
   keeping for 1, 2, and 4 months, respectively.

   contents of complex forms of the DNA molecule absorbing in the studied
   wavelength range (220-320 nm) were constructed by the ALS-MCR soft
   simulation procedure without initial postulation of their chemical
   compositions. The model of equilibrium complex formation describing
   observed changes in the spectra depending on the solution acidity was
   developed on the basis of the matrix method. Intrinsic protonation
   constants of the oligonucleotide ckit4 were calculated. The formation
   of intramolecular complexes between cytosine C.C+ bases in the studied
   DNA molecule is of a cooperative nature, and thei subsequent
   protonation is an anticooperative process.

   We demonstrate selective reflection of visible light from the surface

AB A theory of the polar magneto-optical Kerr effect in a layer of small
   ferromagnetic particles has been developed in the framework of the
   Green's function method of electrodynamics. The manifestation in
   magneto-optics of the local field effect, which is initiated by the
   contribution to the effective field of dipole moments induced in
   particles, has been studied in terms of the model of a square lattice
   of ferromagnetic ellipsoids. The magneto-optical Kerr effect stimulated
   under normal incidence of a linearly polarized electromagnetic wave on
   a layer of particles magnetized perpendicular to the layer plane has
   been analyzed. The dependence of the Kerr rotation angle in an array of
   ellipsoidal Co particles embedded in the transparent dielectric CaF2 on
   the light frequency, the parameters of the ellipsoidal particles, and
   the lattice period (concentration of the magnet in the layer) has been
   studied numerically. It has been shown that, within a broad (2.0-4.5
   eV) spectral range, the local field effect studied as a function of
   increasing concentration of Co particles in the layer manifests itself
   in the reversal of the sign of the Kerr rotation compared to that
   observed in a single ellipsoid or a solid Co film.

   It has been established that the surface of nanoparticles of fcc metals
   with attainment of a low-energy habit can be transformed via correlated
   displacements of atomic groups of the facet in the octahedral plane. It
   has been shown that such a process is similar to the surface diffusion
   of atomic n-mers with the activation energy depending on the facet
   size, and for particles with a diameter d < 3.0 nm the correlated
   displacement of atomic layers proves to be the dominant mechanism of

AB 95% of patients with ductal pancreatic cancer carry 12th codon
   activating mutations in their KRAS2 oncogenes. Early whole body imaging
   of mutant KRAS2 mRNA activation in pancreatic cancer would contribute
   to disease management. Scintigraphic hybridization probes to visualize
   gene activity in vivo constitute a new paradigm in molecular. imaging.
   We have previously imaged mutant KRAS2 mRNA activation in pancreatic
   cancer xenografts by positron emission tomography (PET) based on a
   single radiometal, Cu-64, chelated to a
   1,4,7,10-tetra(carboxymethylaza)cyclododecane (DOTA) chelator,
   connected via a flexible, hydrophilic spacer, aminoethoxyethoxyacetate
   (AEEA), to the N-terminus of a mutant KRAS2 peptide nucleic acid (PNA)
   hybridization probe. A peptide analogue of insulin-like growth factor
   1), connected to a C-terminal AEEA, enabled receptor-mediated
   endocytosis. We hypothesized that a polydiamidopropanoyl (PDAP)
   dendrimer (generation in), with increasing numbers (n) of DOTA
   chelators, extended via an N-terminal AEEA from a mutant KRAS2 PNA with
   a C-terminal AEEA and IGF1 analogue could enable more intense external
   imaging of pancreatic cancer xenografts that overexpress IGF1 receptor
   and mutant KRAS2 mRNA. ([In-111]DOTA-AEEA)(n)-PDAP(m)-AEEA(2)-KRAS(2)
   PNA-AEEA-IGF1 analogues were prepared and administered intravenously
   into immunocompromised mice bearing human AsPC1 (G12D) pancreatic
   cancer xenografts. CAPAN2 (G12V) pancreatic cancer xenografts served as
   a cellular KRAS2 mismatch control. Scintigraphic tumor/muscle image
   intensity ratios for complementary [In-111](n)-PDAP(m)-KRAS2 G12D
   probes increased from 3.1 +/- 0.2 at n = 2, m = 1, to 4.1 +/- 0.3 at n
   = 8, m = 3, to 6.2 +/- 0.4 at n = 16, m = 4, in AsPC1 (G12D)
   xenografts. Single mismatch [In-111]-PDAP(m)-KRAS2 G12 V control probes
   showed lower tumor/muscle ratios(3.0 +/- 0.6 at n = 2, m = 1, 2.6 +/-
   0.9 at n = 8, m = 3, and 3.7 +/- 0.3 at n = 16, m = 4). The mismatch
   results were comparable to the PNA-free [In-111]DOTA control results.
   Simultaneous administration of nonradioactive Gd-n-KRAS2 G12 V probes
   (n = 2 or 8) increased accumulation of [In-111](8)KRAS2 G12 V probes
   3-6-fold in pancreatic cancer CAPAN2 xenografts and other tissues,
   except for a 2-fold decrease in the kidneys. As a result, tissue
   distribution tumor/muscle ratios of In uptake increased from 3.1 +/-
   0.5 to 6.5 +/- 1.0, and the kidney/tumor ratio of In uptake decreased
   by more than 5-fold from 174.8 +/- 17.5 to 30.8 +/- 3.1. Thus, PDAP
   dendrimers with up to 16 DOTA chelators attached to PNA-IGF1 analogs,
   as well as simultaneous administration of the elevated dose of
   nonradioactive Gd-n-KRAS2 G12 V probes, enhanced tumor uptake of
   [In-111](n)KRAS2 PNA probes. These results also imply that Gd(111)
   dendrimeric hybridization probes might be suitable for magnetic
   resonance imaging of gene expression in tumors, because the higher
   generations of the dendrimers, including the NMR contrast Gd-n-KRAS2
   G12 V probes, improved tumor accumulation of the probes and specificity
   of tumor imaging.

AB A summary of the application of cyclodextrins (CDs) in the field of
   supramolecular chemistry has been given. Unique structural features of
   CDs, namely the separation of hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups, cause
   unusual physical and chemical properties of these molecules. The most
   important property of natural or chemically modified CDs is the ability
   to reversibly and selectively bind organic, inorganic, and biological
   molecules, forming inclusion complexes (ICs) of the "guest-host" type
   or nanostructured supramolecular assemblies. The most interesting
   examples of the application of ICs with CDs in pharmaceutical, food,
   and chemical industry, spectrometric analysis, separation technologies,
   of the use of CDs as models for molecular recognition in biology, as
   well as the cyclical component in the construction of supramolecular
   architectures (rotaxanes, pseudorotaxanes) are given in the review. The
   mechanism and methods of the formation of ICs, their properties and the
   methods of analysis have been described. Particular attention has been
   paid to molecular necklaces. One of the new promising directions of the
   application of CDs, namely, the preparation of nanosized materials, has
   been considered.

AB In this manuscript, a new approach in surface plasmon resonance
   microscopy is presented. The method provides optical real-time
   detection of single nanoparticles on surfaces. The potential of the
   method is demonstrated recording spherical dielectric particles as
   small as 40 nm in diameter and single HIV virus-like particles having
   diameters of similar to 100 nm both immobilized on functionalized
   surfaces. The surface plasmon resonance signal in the binding spots was
   found to be almost linearly proportional to the size of the particles
   and, therefore, surpasses the intensity of Mie scattering on spherical
   particle (dependence similar to r(-6)) by orders of magnitude for small
   objects. The physical reason leading to this strong effect is discussed.

   Nanoconfinement was shown to stabilize delta-Ga which is metastable in

   cooling below room temperature. These crystalline modifications were
   stable and coexisted with known gallium phases. Correlations between

AB Light scattering in an axially symmetric composite system of a
   nanoparticle, an oscillating dipole and a metal film (covering a
   dielectric support) is considered. Nanoparticle and dipole are placed
   on the axis of symmetry. The axially oriented dipole is situated
   between film and nanoparticle. The field-enhancement factor at the
   position of the dipole and dipole radiation is calculated on the basis
   of Maxwell's equations, reduced by Green's functions to a system of
   boundary integral equations. The total enhancement of the light
   scattering, which is a product of the enhancement of the field
   intensity and the dipole radiation, depends on many parameters: the
   wavelength of light, the metal permittivity, film thickness, geometry
   of the nanoparticle, angle of incidence of the laser beam, but most
   strongly on the distance between the nanoparticle and film surface.
   According to our calculations, the total enhancement factor for Raman
   radiation can reach huge values in the order of 10(10)-10(11). The
   angular spectrum of the radiating dipole is derived and the accuracy of
   calculations is checked by the optical theorem of reciprocity.

AB The influence of the surrounding gaseous media on optically excited
   fluorescence of YAG:Ce nanoparticles was studied. It was observed that
   the 5d -> 4f fluorescence of Ce3+ ions in YAG nanoparticles
   dramatically depends on the pressure of the gaseous media surrounding
   the powder samples. The observations suggest the possibility of probing
   the pressure at the single molecule level with nanoparticles. It is
   suggested that the observed effects result from gas-molecule-assisted
   electron transfer between the nanoparticles and from modification of
   the surface of the particles by adsorption of gas molecules.

AB The possibility of increasing the thermoelectric figure of merit for

   kinetic coefficients of the nanostructured material have been
   calculated and evaluated under the assumption that the dominant role in
   the transfer is played by the tunneling of electrons between
   nanoparticles. The limiting case of the absence of phonon thermal
   conductivity through barrier layers has been considered. It has been
   demonstrated using the estimates obtained for materials based on Bi2Te3
   that the thermopower in the nanostructured material can be sufficiently
   high and that, despite the low electrical conductivity, the
   dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit can be as large as 3-4 at

AB The distribution of copper- and nickel-containing components in the
   pore space of HZSM-5 zeolite was quantitatively studied. It was found
   that the detailed distribution of a modifier in the micropore and
   mesopore volumes of the zeolite depends on both the chemical nature of
   the modifier and the conditions of supporting and the regime of M2+
   polycondensation in the pore space of the zeolite. The experimental
   data on the low-temperature adsorption of nitrogen on Cu(n)ZSM-5
   catalysts can be interpreted as the result of the partial filling of
   the zeolite micropore space (10 vol %) and the finest mesopores with D
   < 3 nm with the modifier. In the case of Ni(n)ZSM-5 catalysts, the
   penetration of the modifier into zeolite channels (micropores) in
   detectable amounts was not found, and it was arranged in mesopores on
   the surface of zeolite crystallites. The reason for differences between
   modifier distributions in the pore structure of the zeolite was
   explained from the standpoint of different structures of copper and
   nickel polyhydroxo complexes in impregnating solutions after
   polycondensation. It was found that, in the Cu(n)ZSM-5 and Ni(n)ZSM-5
   catalysts, the modifier component contained copper and nickel only in a
   doubly charged state and mainly octahedral oxygen environments. In this
   case, three-dimensional nanoparticles or coarsely dispersed particles
   of CuO were not detected in the pore space of the support, whereas the
   presence of a small amount of sufficiently large NiO crystals with a
   coherent-scattering region of 80-100 nm was detected in Ni(n)ZSM-5, and
   these crystals occurred on the surface of zeolite crystals. It was
   found that the apparent density of a copper-or nickel-containing
   component arranged in the pore space of the zeolite was lower than the
   density of the bulk CuO and NiO phases by a factor of similar to 3 and
   4, respectively, because of the size effect.

   the participation of heterogeneous forms of the catalyst (colloidal

   the proposed model has introduced thermodynamic considerations which
   take into account the energy differences between the nanoparticle
   ensembles from microparticles and macroparticles. A series of
   voltammograms was obtained as a result of calculations and
   characteristic relationships between the different parameters were
   found. An analysis of the findings, on the one hand, predicts the shape

AB We studied the decomposition of CaCO3 by laser heated diamond anvil
   cell experiments at pressures between 9 and 21 GPa up to 4000 K. The
   quenched samples were characterized by micro-Raman spectroscopy. From
   the results we conclude that calcite decomposes into CaO + O-2 + C
   across the whole pressure range investigated at temperatures around
   3500 K, initially forming graphite nanoparticles with dimensions around
   3-11 nm. The graphite particles may aggregate and transform into
   diamond with dimensions around 20 nm if the sample is annealed in the
   diamond stability field. We therefore conclude that diamond can be
   crystallized directly from carbonatitic melts by decomposition of CaCO3
   at high pressures and temperatures, and that phase diagrams showing a
   decomposition into CaO + CO2 in this P, T-range need to be reevaluated.

AB The processes controlling early stages of agglomeration of

   It has been established that the formation of boundaries with twin
   misorientation is the main mechanism of structural relaxation during
   primary agglomeration of nanoparticles. It has been shown that an
   increase in the temperature leads to an increase in the number of twin
   boundaries and that their mutual arrangement depends on the
   misorientation of the nanoparticles. In the case where twin boundaries
   are noncoplanar, structure relaxation results in the formation of
   pentagonal twin boundaries. The role of twinning in the formation of
   interfaces upon compaction of nanoparticles has been discussed.

AB The paper highlights less-common properties of nanosized WO3 thin films
   which make it possible to achieve photolysis in CuCl films via the use
   of a CuCl-WO3 double-layer structure. The WO3 film provides first
   photoinduced detachment of hydrogen atoms from organic molecules
   adsorbed on the oxide surface; the hydrogen atoms, being transferred
   into WO3, turn into electrons and protons which migrate then to the
   CuCl film forming sensitizing centres oil the halide surface being
   illuminated simultaneously with the illumination of the WO3 Surface.
   This in turn gives rise to photolysis in the CuCl films, which does not
   occur without the hydrogen sensitization. The nanosized WO3 film makes
   it possible to trigger two famous surface photochemical reactions,
   first proton-coupled electron transfer between the hydrogen-donor
   molecules and the oxide surface, and then the photolysis of the halide,
   which radically changes the optical parameters of both the WO3 and the
   CuCl films. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Using the localized surface plasmon resonance as a probe in solid and
   liquid Sn nanoparticles of 107 nm diameter and 52 nm height, we have
   studied their kinetics of melting and freezing at temperature ramps
   and, for the first time, at fixed temperatures. During temperature
   ramps, the kinetics exhibit distinct hysteresis. The melting occurs
   near the bulk melting point while the freezing is observed at much
   lower temperatures so that the undercooling interval is similar to 130
   K. The time scale of the freezing kinetics measured at different fixed
   temperatures rapidly decreases as the latter are lowered. All these
   findings have been quantitatively described by assuming the nucleation
   to occur on the edges of nanoparticles and employing the classical
   nucleation theory with the corresponding modifications.

AB Photochemical reactions of organic molecules in the solid state have an
   excellent potential in green chemistry technologies as they often
   proceed in high yields to give a single product without generating
   volatile organic solvent waste. While recent synthetic applications
   highlight the need for a better understanding of reaction mechanisms
   and kinetics, spectroscopic observations of excited states and
   short-lived intermediates in single crystals and powdered samples have
   been extremely challenging due to the high optical density and
   scattering power of single crystals and powdered samples. In this
   communication, we report the first direct observation of a radical pair
   triplet state by time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR)
   with nanocrystals of 4,4'dmethoxy-dicumyl ketone (10Me) suspended in
   water. Steady state irradiation of 10Me had previously shown that
   reactions in dry powders and nanocrystalline suspensions proceed with
   high efficiency and chemoselectivity, to generate
   4,4'-dimethoxy-dicumene 20Me by decarbonylation and radical coupling.
   The nanocrystalline suspensions were excited with an 25 ns laser pulse
   at 308 nm using a flow system within the cavity of a time-resolved EPR
   spectrometer. The resulting TREPR spectra showed strong spin
   polarization with enhanced absorption A and emission E signals in an
   AAAEEE pattern characteristic of a randomly oriented triplet with
   zero-field splitting parameters D = 243 G and E = 11 G as well as an
   isotropic exchange integral J = -45000 G. The assignment of this
   spectrum to a radical pair triplet state was supported by measurements
   carried out in fluid solution and in frozen glasses, which allowed for
   the characterization of the free radical and the triplet excited
   molecular state of the starting ketone 10Me.

AB In this paper we report the synthesis of robust and efficient
   nanocatalysts based on Pt-containing nanoparticles (NPS) formed in the
   pores of hypercrosslinked polystyrene (HPS) and their catalytic
   performance in the phenol CWAO under mild conditions. The Pt species
   were incorporated in HPS using wet impregnation of platinic acid in
   tetrahydrofuran followed by NaHCO3 treatment. The catalysts containing
   from 0.11 to 4.85 wt.% of Pt were studied by X-ray fluorescence
   analysis, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray absorption
   spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and liquid nitrogen
   physisorption methods. The NP sizes were found to be independent of the
   amount of platinic acid used for impregnation, but rather controlled by
   the pores of HPS. Three types of Pt species: Pt(0), Pt(II), and Pt(IV),
   constituted the NP composition. The effects of the phenol and catalyst
   initial concentrations and temperature were investigated in the phenol
   CWAO. Removal of 97% of the phenol with 94.2% selectivity to CO2 and
   H2O were observed for the most active catalyst containing 0.95 wt.% Pt.
   These parameters are significantly higher than those for the
   conventional Al2O3-Pt catalyst with the similar amount of the active
   metal or for Pt(5%)/activated carbon. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Pentagonal nanorods (PNRs) and nanoparticles (PNPs) covered by
   mismatched shell layers are theoretically investigated. Mechanical
   stresses and elastic energies of such objects are calculated
   analytically and analyzed in the framework of linear isotropic
   elasticity. Difference between elastic modules of core and shell is
   taken into account. The threshold radiuses as the minimal radiuses of
   PNR and PNP for which the formation of the shell layer is energetically
   favorable are found. The threshold radius is approximately 10 nm for
   PNPs and 100 nm for PNRs of typical face-centered cubic (FCC) metals.

AB Gold nanoparticles with silver nanoshells are obtained by synthesizing
   gold nanorods in a growing solution containing cetyltrimethylammonium
   bromide, subsequent separation in a concentration gradient of glycerol,
   and reduction of silver nitrate by ascorbic acid under alkaline
   conditions in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone. The formation of
   silver nanoshells was monitored by the shift of plasmon resonances of
   extinction and differential light scattering, by the appearance of
   characteristics peaks of silver in the energy dispersive X-ray (EDX)
   spectra of samples, by the data of transmission electron microscopy,
   and by visual changes in the color of colloids. The spectrum of the
   intensity ratio of the co- and cross-polarized compo- nents of light
   scattered by gold-silver nanorods is measured for the first time, and
   it is observed that the maximum is shifted by 80-100 nm compared to
   previously published spectra of gold nanorods (Khlebtsov et al., J.
   Phys. Chem. C 112, 12760 (2008)). The extinction and light scattering
   spectra are calculated by the method of separation of variables using
   the model of a confocal two-layer spheroid and these calculations are
   found to agree with spectral measurements. A method for determining the
   thickness of a silver nanolayer by the spectral shift of an extinction
   longitudinal resonance is described. The obtained data of optical
   spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy and estimations of
   the mass of the deposited metal show that the aver-age thickness of the
   silver layer varies from 0.12 to 4 nm as the Ag/Au ratio changes from
   2/80 to 90/80 mu g/mu g.

AB We report an experimental demonstration of real-time in situ x-ray
   diffraction investigations of clustering and dynamic strain in early
   stages of nanoparticle growth in Al-Cu alloys. Simulations involving a
   simplified model of local strain are well correlated with the x-ray
   diffraction data, suggesting a redistribution of point defects and the
   formation of nanoscale clusters in the bulk material. A modal,
   representative nanoparticle size is determined subsequent to the final
   stage of artificial aging. Such investigations are imperative for the
   understanding, and ultimately the control, of nanoparticle nucleation
   and growth in this technologically important alloy. (C) 2010 American

AB A large number of interesting phenomena related to the insertion of
   colloidal particles in liquid crystals (LC) have recently been
   reported. Here, we investigate effects caused by the addition of
   spherically shaped ferroelectric nanoparticles to a nematic liquid
   crystal. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the density of LC
   molecules, the orientational order parameter, and the polar and
   azimuthal angle profiles are calculated as functions of the distance to
   the center of the immersed nanoparticle for different temperatures of
   the system. We observe that the assembly of ferroelectric nanoparticles
   enhances the nematic order in the LC medium changing many properties of
   its host above the nematic-isotropic transition temperature T (*) (NI) .

   nanoparticle under the influence of the reaction media. The influence
   of monomolecular and dissociative adsorption on the particles
   equilibrium shape and surface morphology has been studied. It has been
   shown that by taking into account attraction "adsorbate-metal" the
   reshaping of the initial hemispheric particle into the truncated
   pyramidal one occurs induced by adsorption. similar to the
   experimentally observed reversible reshaping of active nanoparticles.

AB A nonperturbative method is developed to calculate the energy losses
   from fast, highly charged, heavy ions in collisions with complex
   molecules and nanoparticles. All possible processes of excitation and
   ionization of both projectile and target are taken into account. The
   contributions to energy losses due to multiple collisions are
   calculated, and the effect of target orientation with respect to the
   direction of projectile motion is examined. As examples, the energy
   losses in collisions with the XeF4 molecule and a C-300 nanotube are
   determined. It is shown that the effect of multiple collisions leads to
   significant change in energy loss with target orientation, being
   insignificant for randomly oriented targets.

   pronounced heterogeneity of the PHEMA and PU glass transitions'
   dynamics and the effects of considerable suppression of dynamics and
   increasing elastic properties by silica additives were shown. It was
   caused by formation of peculiarly cross-linked structures due to
   odouble hybridization,o in particular via selective covalent bonding of
   the silica surface, functionalized by -OH, -NH2 or -CH=CH2 groups, with
   the matrix constituents. The silica dispersion remained unchanged in
   these nanocomposites; therefore the relationships between interfacial
   interactions and dynamics/modulus behavior could be followed.

AB A simple photometric method for determining the electrophoretic
   mobility of nano- and microparticles in reverse micelles and in
   solvents with a low dielectric permittivity (2-5) has been developed.
   The method is based oil the use of a thermostatically controlled
   diaphragm-based optical cell (length 2 cm) with three vertical
   plane-parallel electrodes (2 x 3 cm; interelectrode gap, 0.3 cm) placed
   into a standard photocolorimeter. When an electrostatic field (100-600
   V) is applied, the particles begin to move away from the electrode of
   the same polarity. The path traveled by the particles fora given time
   (2-30 s) is calculated from the change in the optical density of the
   solution in the near-elect rode zone. The electrophoretic potential of
   nanoparticles in the model systems, calculated from the values of
   electrophoretic mobility by Huckel-Onsager theory, varied from 70 (Ag
   nanoparticles in AOT micelles in decane) to -73 mV (aggregated SiO2
   nanoparticles in a decane-chloroform mixture). Calculations by the
   classical Deryaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory determined the
   contribution of the electrostatic interaction to the stability of the
   studied systems. We have shown that the surface charge of nanoparticles
   permits: (1) an electrophoretic concentration of the charged
   nanoparticles (Ag) with ail enrichment factor of up to 10(4), (2) the
   separation of nanoparticles with zero (C-60) and a high (Ag)
   electrokinetic potentials, and (3) the formation of electrostatically
   bound aggregates (Ag-SiO2) through the heterocoagulation of oppositely
   charged particles.

AB In this paper we are observing the behavior of low-temperature heat
   capacity for metal beta-diketonates to detect the relation between
   thermodynamic and structural characteristics of these metals. As a
   starting point, a correlation between the heat capacity and the
   molecule's effective size was detected for metal tris-beta-diketonates:
   Al(C5H7O2)(3), Cr(C5H7O2)(3), Fe(C5H7O2)(3), Ir(C5H7O2)(3),
   Fe(C11H19O2)(3), and Fe(C5HF6O2)(3). If we consider the nature Of Such
   an interrelation we call see how the observed correlation is connected
   with the changes of intermolecular interactions in a number of
   compounds under Study. It is demonstrated that universal behavior of
   the heat capacity oil a wide range of temperatures call be observed for
   metal beta-diketonates with identical ligands. The explanation of the
   detected regularity is related to the identical Structure in a
   short-range ordering, which initiates the coincidence in the vibration
   spectrum of these objects in a high frequency range. A simple equation
   has been put forward For the framework of detected regularities to
   describe heat capacity behavior in compounds considering a wide range
   of temperatures. The results obtained can be used in calculating and
   forecasting thermodynamic characteristics of unstudied objects of metal
   beta-diketonate classes, for those where Structural data are known,
   Observing the degree of generality of the results obtained, we came to
   think that the regularities that we detected can be observed within
   other classes of molecular crystals.

   than Me(2)Spm. Condensation resulted in nanoparticles with hydrodynamic
   radii between 39.6 and 48.4 nm, and electron microscopy showed the
   presence of toroids and spheroids. Natural polyamines and stereoisomers
   of Me(2)Spm protected DNA against DNase digestion and oxidative stress
   in vitro and against etoposide and oxidative stress in DU145 cells but
   afforded little protection against UV-C irradiation. Our findings
   indicate that Me(2)Spm stereoisomers are efficient DNA packaging agents
   with potential applications in gene delivery. Our study also reveals
   stereospecificity in DNA interaction and protection against cellular
   stress.

AB Usually Ultra Cold Neutrons (UCN) and Very Cold Neutrons (VCN) are not
   efficiently scattered by individual atoms in matter due to their large
   wavelength. On the contrary, such neutrons are coherently scattered by
   nanoparticles, providing a powerful tool, in particular for VCN
   reflectors, for VCN storage in closed traps, probably for
   'quasi-specular' reflectors for cold neutrons, and for cooling VCN to
   the UCN energy range. On the other hand, quasi-elastic scattering of
   UCN at nanoparticles and large molecules (as those of Fomblin oil) in
   all presently used UCN trap wall materials causes false effects in the
   neutron lifetime measurements because of poorly controlled spectrum
   evolution. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The optical coefficients of a nonlinearity for a macroscopic ensemble
   of aggregates of metal nanoparticles that is caused by deformation of
   the spatial structure of clusters in a strong light field are
   calculated for the first time. For a continuous medium that consists of
   a nonabsorbing dielectric containing aggregated silver nanoparticles
   that do not possess an intrinsic optical nonlinearity, coefficients of
   nonlinear absorption are obtained in relation to the intensity and
   frequency of incident light. It is shown that, at intensities of up to
   a few megawatts per square centimeter, the addition to the absorption
   of a nanocomposite to be modeled is adequately described by a
   third-order nonlinearity. The magnitude and sign of the nonlinear
   absorption coefficient agree well with the previously obtained
   experimental data for aggregated silver and gold colloids under
   nanosecond excitation.

AB This work examines IR multiphoton excitation of SF6 molecules subliming
   from the surface of (CO2)(N) van der Waals clusters (nanoparticles) in
   a cluster beam (the number of monomers per cluster, N >= 10(2)). The
   SF6 molecules are captured by clusters when a cluster beam intersects a
   molecular beam and sublime from the cluster surface after a certain
   time, carrying information about the velocity and temperature (internal
   energy) of the clusters. The multiphoton absorption spectra of the SF6
   molecules subliming from the cluster surface are markedly narrower than
   those of the SF6 molecules in the parent, gas-dynamically cooled
   molecular beam, indicating that the vibrational temperature of the
   molecules subliming from the cluster surface is lower. Therefore, the
   proposed technique can be used to produce strongly vibrationally cooled
   molecules, which are of interest for a number of applications, in
   particular for achieving high-selectivity IR multiphoton excitation and
   isotopically selective dissociation of molecules.

AB The stability of the beta phase in cubic zirconium nanoparticles has
   been calculated as a function of the size r (r varies in the range from
   2.5 to 11.5 nm) by the molecular dynamics method with the many-body
   interatomic interaction potential obtained within the embedded-atom
   model. It has been demonstrated that the temperature T (k) at which the
   cubic cluster of body-centered cubic zirconium becomes structurally
   unstable depends nonlinearly on the particle size. The curve T (k) (r)
   exhibits a pronounced maximum in the range r a parts per thousand
   4.3-4.7 nm. It has been established that the mechanism of the
   structural transition from the body-centered cubic phase to the
   hexagonal close-packed phase depends substantially on the particle
   size. For particles with sizes in the range from 2.5 to 5.0 nm, there
   exists a temperature range in which the transition from the
   body-centered cubic phase to the hexagonal close-packed phase remains
   incomplete for a long time. In this case, two phases coexist and the
   initial particle undergoes a strong deformation along the habit plane.

AB The effect of a point load on the oscillations of the quartz crystal
   microbalance (QCM) is represented with a simple one-dimensional model
   constructed specially for the determination of the basic physical
   characteristics of solitary nanoparticles. Due to the analytical form
   of solution, the model is highly selective and sensitive to small mass
   load and is quite suitable for the identification of solitary viruses.
   Thickness shear mode in a quartz crystal microbalance is modelled with
   longitudinal oscillations of a pair of thin elastic strips, with the
   free parameters calibrated on the basis of experiment. This approach
   reduces a complicated three-dimensional problem to a one-dimensional
   one and assesses the effect of distributed and localized mass load on
   the frequency response of a real QCM. A change of the frequency shift
   depending on the weight and position of a point body is demonstrated;
   the ratios of signal intensities at different harmonics accompanying
   the rupture of the body from the surface due to inertia in the air and
   in a viscous liquid are considered. The model is developed for the
   determination of parameters of solitary biological nano-sized bodies:
   mass, size, and bond rupture force. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB We have studied the electron transport in SiO2(Co)/GaAs and SiO2(Co)/Si
   heterostructures, where the SiO2(Co) structure is the granular SiO2
   film with Co nanoparticles. In SiO2(Co)/GaAs heterostructures giant
   magnetoresistance effect is observed. The effect has positive values,
   is expressed when electrons are injected from the granular film into
   the GaAs semiconductor, and has the temperature-peak-type character.
   The temperature location of the effect depends on the Co concentration
   and can be shifted by the applied electrical field. For the
   SiO2(Co)/GaAs heterostructure with 71 at. % Co the magnetoresistance
   reaches 1000 (10(5)%) at room temperature. On the contrary, for
   SiO2(Co)/Si heterostructures magnetoresistance values are very small
   (4%) and for SiO2(Co) films the magnetoresistance has an opposite
   value. High values of the magnetoresistance effect in SiO2(Co)/GaAs
   heterostructures have been explained by magnetic field-controlled
   process of impact ionization. The spin-dependent potential barrier is
   formed in the accumulation electron layer in the semiconductor near the
   interface. The impact ionization induced by injected electrons produces
   holes, which move, are accumulated in the region of the potential
   barrier and lower the barrier height. The height decrease grows the
   electron current flowing through the barrier and leads to the
   enhancement of the avalanche. Due to the formed positive feedback small
   variations in the barrier height lead to great changes in the current.
   The applied magnetic field increases the height and reduces the
   transparency of the barrier. As a result, small feedback reduction
   suppresses the onset of the impact ionization. The spin-dependent
   potential barrier is formed by the exchange interaction between
   electrons in the accumulation electron layer in the semiconductor and d
   electrons of Co. Existence of spin-polarized localized electron states
   in the accumulation layer results in the temperature-peak-type
   character of the barrier, which is manifested in the magnetoresistance
   effect. Spin injectors and efficient magnetic sensors on the base of
   ferromagnet/semiconductor heterostructures with holes traps and quantum
   wells containing spin-polarized localized electrons in the
   semiconductor at the interface are considered.

   detected using an optical system that permits one to simultaneously
   measure the radiation force exerted on and fluorescence emission from
   the scatterer. The core of this technique is a partially metal covered
   dielectric bead optically trapped in a liquid with dye molecules.
   Fluorescence emission from the volume that includes the bead is
   measured simultaneously with the Brownian motion of the bead. The
   perturbed motion of the bead is a result of photon momentum transfer
   from the fluorescence of the dye to the trapped scatterer. The bead
   position fluctuations indicate the presence of the fluorescence and its
   bleaching nature. The results demonstrate the capability of the
   photonic force microscopy technique to be a complement to spectroscopy
   in the study of optical processes.

SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AND THEORETICAL PHYSICS
LA English
DT Article
ID LOSCHMIDT ECHO
AB The quantum dynamics of a simple model of a nanoparticle has been
   investigated. This model suggests that the initially prepared state
   (system) interacts with the other states (reservoir) forming a dense
   discrete spectrum. In contrast to our previous papers concerned with
   this problem [1, 2], in which only the dynamics of the system has been
   studied, the present paper is devoted to the description of the
   evolution of reservoir states. In the initial recurrence cycles, the
   reverse transitions from the reservoir to the system generate a double
   resonance (an echo at frequencies of the reservoir states transitions).
   Since different states of the reservoir are depleted at different
   instants of time, the Loschmidt echo in the system is inhomogeneously
   broadened, whereas the double resonances remain narrower and more
   intense. Apart from the main resonances, there arise satellites due to
   the redistribution of the populations between the reservoir states
   during the cycle. In mixing cycles regime, the regular evolution of the
   reservoir states (like the system state) transforms into a
   stochastic-like evolution. It is noted that the predicted double
   resonances can be experimentally detected and used in analyzing
   vibrational relaxation of large molecules and nanoparticles.

AB The effect of M-F excimer laser radiation on a composite layer

   is studied as a function of the number of laser nanosecond pulses. The
   silver nanoparticles are synthesized by ion implantation. The measured
   optical absorption of the composite layer demonstrates that the silver
   nanoparticle size decreases monotonically as the number of laser Pulses
   increases. Rutherford backscattering shows that laser annealing is
   accompanied by silver diffusion into the bulk of the glass and partial
   metal evaporation from the sample Surface. The detected decrease in the
   silver nanoparticle size is discussed in terms of simultaneous melting
   of silver nanoparticles and the glass matrix due to the absorption of
   laser radiation.

AB We present a proof-of-principle study of superconducting single photon
   detectors (SSPD) for the detection of individual neutral
   molecules/nanoparticles at low energies. The new detector is applied to
   characterize a laser desorption source for biomolecules and allows
   retrieval of the arrival time distribution of a pulsed molecular beam
   containing the amino acid tryptophan, the polypeptide gramicidin as
   well as insulin, myoglobin and hemoglobin. We discuss the experimental
   evidence that the detector is actually sensitive to isolated neutral
   particles.

AB The structure, phase composition, and magnetic properties of carbon
   nanotubes filled with iron nanoparticles and obtained by thermolysis of
   a mixture of ferrocene and C-60 fullerene or ferrocene and orthoxylene
   at a temperature of 800 degrees C are investigated. Electron
   microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Mossbauer spectroscopy data lead to
   the conclusion that carbon nanotubes are multilayer systems partially
   filled with iron nanoparticles and/or nanorods. Metallic inclusions in
   nanotube channels form alpha-Fe, gamma-Fe, and Fe3C phases. The
   concentration of each phase in the samples is determined. It is shown
   that 10-20-nm iron clusters in nanotubes exhibit magnetic properties
   typical of bulk phases of iron. High elasticity of carbon nanotube
   walls facilitates stabilization of the high-temperature gamma-Fe phase;
   the relative concentration of this phase in a sample can be increased
   by lowering the concentration of ferrocene in the initial reaction
   mixture.

AB Linear arrays of plasmonic nanoparticles have been suggested by various
   groups as optical waveguides. Here, inspired by the concept of optical
   nanocircuits, we show that it is possible to improve the performance of
   such waveguide chains by pairing two of them, forming a two-wire
   optical transmission line. We show that choosing the operation regime
   near the light line may greatly reduce the effect of material
   absorption and disorder, still allowing field confinement in between
   the paired chains. Application for low-loss optical interconnects and
   subwavelength imaging devices are envisioned.

DE nanodispersed composites; numerical simulation of condensation
AB A model based on the Langmuir adsorption model and a program for
   numerical simulation of nucleation and condensation on a cooled
   substrate were developed to describe the nonstationary phenomena
   observed in experiments on the production of nanodispersed composites
   by vacuum deposition of a two-component vapor. Calculations performed
   for a mixture of silver and water vapor have shown that the nucleation
   processes of the condensed phases of the components mutually stimulate
   each other with silver nucleation playing a leading role. A number of
   unusual phenomena have been found: an increase in the relative rate of
   water vapor condensation with a decrease in its partial pressure; the
   absence of stationary condensation modes; the existence of a boundary
   regime that separates modes with increasing and decreasing silver
   concentration in the condensate; the formation of porous skeletons
   consisting of a condensate of one of the components filled with
   nanoparticles of the other component. The dispersion properties of the
   condensates for various condensation modes and the adhesion of the
   condensate to the substrate were determined.

AB A double-layer AgCl-WO3 structure was employed to produce photochemical
   hydrogen for doping of an AgCl film. Atomic photochemical hydrogen,
   detached under the action of light from hydrogen donor molecules,
   previously adsorbed on the WO3 surface, migrated through the WO3 film
   into the AgCl film, which provided doping of the AgCl surface and
   yielded hydrogen sensitization simultaneous to illumination and yielded
   the enhancement of photochromism in the AgCl films. The atomic hydrogen
   played the role of a reducing agent and triggered the formation of
   sensitization centers on the halide surface, which in turn facilitated
   the growth of silver clusters and colloids under the action of light.
   The double-layer AgCl-WO3 structure realizes the idea of two-stage
   catalysis: first the oxide surface catalyses hydrogen production under
   the action of light, then the photochemical hydrogen atoms act as
   catalysts during the photolysis of the halide. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB Polarized neutron reflectometry is used to investigate SiO2(CO)
   granular films (70at% of Co nanoparticles in SiO2 matrix) deposited on
   Si and GaAs substrates. The aim of the study is to compare
   magnetization depth profiles in two systems: in SiO2(Co)/GaAs
   heterostructure which shows at room temperature giant injection
   magnetoresistance (IMR) with the system SiO2(CO)/Si which reveals
   almost no IMR effect. We found that at room temperature and at the same
   value of external magnetic field mean magnetization in the
   SiO2(Co)/GaAs sample is much higher than in the case of SiO2(Co)/Si. We
   also demonstrate that magnetic scattering length density, and hence,
   magnetization profile strongly depends on the substrate. We show that
   SiO2(Co)/Si heterostructure is ferromagnetically ordered within the
   temperature range between 120 and 460 K what could explain a weak IMR.

AB Processes of ballistic and hot electron relaxation in extended bulk as

   phonon-based scattering model and respective Monte-Carlo computer
   simulation. Optical as well as acoustic phonons are taken into account.
   Trajectories of electrons and their energy attenuation in
   nanostructured silica are additionally affected by scattering processes
   at the grain boundaries between the nanoparticles, i.e. by surface
   phonon as well as potential scattering. Moreover, a flatter conduction
   band and a higher effective electron mass have been taken into account

   of several eV, but still below the valence band ionization threshold,
   were thermalized in 50-300 fs increasing with the silica grain size
   from 1 nm up to bulk material. The electron emission probabilities over

AB Solid samples of vitrified model liquid radioactive wastes (LRWs) are
   produced by treating their components with hydrochloric
   acid-water-alcohol solutions containing ethoxysilane hydrolysates and
   aqueous silica sols at pH 1.5-4.0. The silica sols are prepared by the
   membrane concentration of natural hydrothermal solutions. The
   characteristics of solid vitrified samples are determined using X-ray
   powder diffraction, thermogravimetry, IR spectroscopy, and electron
   microscopy. It is established that, in the acidic water-alcohol medium,
   ethoxysilane hydrolysates, silica sol nanoparticles, and dissolved
   salts of liquid radioactive wastes form a spatially structured
   inorganic siloxane copolymer.

AB The action of KrF excimer laser radiation on the composite material
   consisting of the silica glass with copper nanoparticles is
   investigated as a function of the number of nanosecond laser pulses.
   Metal nanoparticles are synthesized by ion implantation. It is
   established using optical reflectance measurements of composite layers
   that, at the initial stage, the irradiation leads to the fragmentation
   of the largest nanoparticles. Then, after irradiation by several
   pulses, the particles become larger due to the heating of the glass.
   The laser treatment for a longer time (several tens and hundreds of
   pulses) results in the dissociation of nanoparticles into small
   clusters and individual atoms. The mechanisms responsible for the
   modification of the composite material under high-power laser radiation
   are discussed.

AB In an effort to find conditions favouring bioelectrocatalytic reduction
   of oxygen by surface-immobilised human ceruloplasmin (Cp), direct
   electron transfer (DET) reactions between Cp and an extended range of
   surfaces were considered. Exploiting advances in surface
   nanotechnology, bare and carbon-nanotube-modified spectrographic
   graphite electrodes as well as bare, thiol- and
   gold-nanoparticle-modified gold electrodes were considered, and
   ellipsometry provided clues as to the amount and form of adsorbed Cp.
   DET was studied under different conditions by cyclic voltammetry and
   chronoamperometry. Two Faradaic processes with midpoint potentials of
   about 400 mV and 700 mV vs. NHE, corresponding to the redox
   transformation of copper sites of Cp. were clearly observed. In spite
   of the significant amount of Cp adsorbed on the electrode surfaces, as
   well as the quite fast DET reactions between the redox enzyme and
   electrodes, bioelectrocatalytic reduction of oxygen by immobilised Cp
   was never registered. The bioelectrocatalytic inertness of this complex
   multi-functional redox enzyme interacting with a variety of surfaces
   might be associated with a very complex mechanism of intramolecular
   electron transfer involving a kinetic trapping behaviour. (C) 2009

   excitation. The dependence of the nonlinear refractive index n (2) on
   the degree of hydrosol aggregation is studied experimentally at the
   wavelength lambda=1.064 mu m. It is found that n (2) changes sign when
   the degree of hydrosol aggregation is increased. Various physical
   effects occurring in resonant domains of the aggregates are analyzed
   using a simple physical model of two bound silver nanoparticles. The
   theory takes into account thermal, elastic, electrostatic, and
   light-induced effects. Experimental results are discussed in the

   photo-reduced from silver nitride (AgNO3) solution using
   visible-light-activated titanium dioxide (TiO2), which can be a
   convenient and effective substrate for surface enhanced Raman
   spectroscopy (SERS) observation. Visible-light-activated
   carbon-containing TiO2 nanoparticles are applied to photo-reduce and
   form nano-structured silver from AgNO3 upon visible-light illumination.
   Photo-reduced nano-structured silver is used as an active substrate for
   SERS studies of TiO2 as well as nano diamond and TiO2. The photo
   reduction of AgNO3 and SERS observation can be obtained by
   simultaneously using the same visible laser excitation. The coexistence
   of the anatase phase with small admixture of the rutile phase in the
   TiO2 can be observed using SERS. The carbon structure in the
   carbon-containing TiO2 was determined to be sp(2) type carbon bonding

ID IMPLANTATION; POLYMER; FILMS; NUCLEATION; GLASS
AB A method is described for the ion synthesis of silver nanoparticles in
   epoxy resin that is in a viscous-fluid state (viscosity 30 Pa s) during
   irradiation. The viscous-fluid or glassy polymer is implanted by 30-keV
   silver ions at a current density of 4 mu A/cm(2) in the ion beam in the
   dose range 2.2 x 10(16) - 7.5 x 10(16) ions/cm(2). The epoxy layers
   thus synthesized contain silver nanoparticles, which are studied by
   transmission electron microscopy and optical absorption spectroscopy.

   of the implanted impurity, which stimulates the nucleation and growth

AB Nanosized hydroxyapatite (nano-HA) is known to be of enhanced
   biological efficacy, being used in medical events as a mix with
   physiological solution, saline or patient's blood before the
   application. This study is aimed at the investigation of the time
   evolution of both phase composition and particle size of nano-HA in
   aqueous (isotonic 0.9% NaCl) solution. An energy-dispersive X-ray
   diffraction method, allowing the real time rapid data collection was
   employed. The X-ray amorphous component of initial powder was shown to
   convert fully into the crystalline hydroxyapatite (HA), the
   characteristic crystallization time being of approximately 25 min. The
   initial crystallite average size (approximately 35 nm) was enlarged by
   a factor of about 4 within the first 100 min after mixing the powder
   with the physiological solution and no more structural changes were
   detected during the following period. The sigmoidal kinetics of the HA
   crystal growth was evidenced. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB A thermal reduction method has been developed to prepare
   magnetite/hematite nanocomposites and pure magnetite nanoparticles
   targeted for specific applications. The relative content of hematite
   alpha-Fe2O3 and magnetite Fe3O4 nanoparticles in the product was
   ensured by maintaining proper conditions in the thermal reduction of
   alpha-Fe2O3 powder in the presence of a high boiling point solvent. The
   structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of the nanocomposites
   were investigated by Fe-57-Moumlssbauer spectroscopy, x-ray
   diffraction, and magnetic measurements. The content of hematite and
   magnetite phases was evaluated at every step of the chemical and
   thermal treatment. It is established that not all iron ions in the
   octahedral B-sites of magnetite nanoparticles participate in the
   electron hopping Fe2+-><- Fe3+ above the Verwey temperature T-V, and
   that the charge distribution can be expressed as
   (Fe3+)(tet)[Fe1.852.5+Fe0.153+](oct)O-4. It is shown that surface
   effects, influencing the electronic states of iron ions, dominate the
   vacancy effect, and thus govern the observed specific features of the
   Verwey transition and magnetic properties. The sharp increase in
   coercivity observed in magnetite nanoparticles below T-V is much
   stronger than for bulk magnetite.

AB The preparation of new types of nanosystems based on metallic yttrium
   nanoparticles, which are difficult to produce by traditional methods
   due to the high melting temperature and the extremely high
   oxidizability of this metal, has been investigated. The materials are
   prepared on an original high-vacuum setup intended for the formation of
   metal nanoparticle beams by laser ablation. Yttrium nanoparticles are
   synthesized, and their chemical reactions with hydrogen are studied at
   room temperature. It is found that the reaction at low hydrogen
   pressures (similar to 10(-3) Pa) leads to the formation of YH2
   dihydride particles with metal properties. An increase in the hydrogen
   pressure to similar to 100 Pa results in the transformation of
   metal-like YH2 nanoparticles into dielectric YH3 - x (x < 1)
   nanoparticles. It is revealed that the last reaction corresponding to
   the metal-dielectric phase transition is reversible with respect to the
   pressure of the hydrogen atmosphere.

AB The method for carbothermal reduction of spherical particles of
   amorphous silicon dioxide is developed, and hexagonal alpha-SiC
   polytype nanocrystals are synthesized. The prepared samples are
   characterized by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy,
   photoluminescence spectroscopy, and electron microscopy. The silicon
   carbide nanocrystals prepared have sizes in the range 5-50 nm depending
   on the diameter of initial silicon dioxide particles. A detailed
   analysis of the positions of the lines in the Raman spectra, their
   broadening, and shift makes it possible to reliably establish that the
   samples under investigation predominantly contain the 6H and 4H silicon
   carbide polytypes and insignificant amounts of the 2H and 3C phases.
   The 15R and 21R polytypes in the samples are absent. It is noted that
   the samples are characterized by a substantial size effect: the
   luminescence intensity of small silicon carbide nanocrystals is more
   than three times higher than that of large SiC nanocrystals.

   of viscousfluid epoxy resin (at a viscosity of 20-120 Pa s) having room
   temperature, which is well below the glass transition temperature of
   the polymer. As a result, epoxy resin layers containing silver
   nanoparticles in their volume form; these nanoparticles are studied by

   Various types of disperse structures formed by metallic nanoparticles
   in the polymer are detected. The morphology of the composite material
   is found to be controlled by the polymer viscosity and the metal

AB The effect of an electron beam on nanoparticles of two Fe carbide
   catalysts inside a carbon nanofiber was investigated in a transmission
   electron microscope. Electron beam exposure does not result in
   significant changes for cementite (theta-Fe3C). However, for Hagg
   carbide nanoparticles (chi-Fe5C2), explosive decay is observed after
   exposure for 5-10 s. This produces small particles of cementite and
   gamma-Fe, each covered with a multilayer carbon shell, and
   significantly modifies the carbon-fiber structure. It is considered
   that the decomposition of Hagg carbide is mostly due to the damage
   induced by high-energy electron collisions with the crystal lattice,
   accompanied by the heating of the particle and by mechanical stress
   provided by the carbon layers of the nanofiber.

AB Metal-carbon nanocomposites based on nickel, palladium, and iron and
   bimetallic palladium-nickel-carbon nanocomposites were for the first
   time used as catalysts of hydrodechlorination of chlorobenzene in the
   vapor phase in the atmosphere of hydrogen. Nickel and Pd-Ni
   nanoparticles completely coated by a carbon layer not only were stable
   to oxidation and agglomeration but also exhibited considerable activity
   in hydrodechlorination of chlorobenzene at temperatures much lower than
   those at which dechlorination on carbon carriers occurred. The
   dependence of catalytic properties (activity, selectivity, and
   stability) on temperature and nanocomposite composition was studied.
   Depending on the nature of the metal, the composition of bimetallic
   particles and temperature the selectivity could be changed, and the
   reaction could be directed toward the formation of benzene or
   cyclohexane. Carbon coating was stable under reaction conditions at
   least up to 350A degrees C and did not hinder hydrodechlorination.
   Substrate adsorption likely occurred on the outside carbon surface of
   composite particles. The activity and structure of Ni@C composite
   remained almost unchanged after triple cycling over the temperature
   range from 50 to 350A degrees C in a flow system.

AB The process of penetration of cobalt atoms through the h-BN nanomesh on
   Rh(111) is investigated with both spectroscopic and microscopic
   techniques. It is discovered that oxygen coadsorption can drastically
   modify the physical properties and behavior of the deposited Co
   clusters upon postannealing. In the absence of oxygen, Co forms small
   nanoparticles in the pores (bonding parts) of the h-BN nanomesh, which
   start to agglomerate at elevated temperatures without any considerable
   intercalation. However, even a tiny amount of coadsorbed oxygen reduces
   cobalt agglomeration and greatly promotes its intercalation and
   trapping under h-BN. The oxygen exposure necessary for a complete
   intercalation of 1-2 monolayers of Co is very low, and the formation of
   oxidic species can be easily avoided, The nanomesh structure remains
   intact upon intercalating submonolayer amounts of Co, while further
   intercalation gradually distorts and finally destroys the periodic
   corrugation. Fortunately, this process is not accompanied by damaging
   the h-BN sheet itself, and the original structure can be restored by
   removing Co upon annealing at higher temperatures.

AB The main focus of this paper is the description of qualitatively new
   facilities for diagnostics of biological and medical objects and
   medical therapy obtained by applications of nanocrystalline
   scintillators. These facilities are based on abilities of
   nanoscintillators to selective conjugation with various biomolecular
   objects and noticeable variations of their atomic structures, Xray
   diffraction (XRD) patterns, and light-emission characteristics induced
   by modifications of conditions on their external surfaces. Experimental
   results presented in this paper provide development of detection in
   vivo just inside a living organism of various viruses, cancer cells,
   and other pathological macromolecules by means of scanning X-ray
   diffractometry of nanoparticles introduced into the body. These data
   are produced by selective adsorption of pathological bioobjects by
   these nanoparticles and subsequent modifications of their XRD patterns.
   Application of narrow collimated X-ray beams and new types of X-ray
   detector matrices providing microscopic spatial resolution due to usage
   of nanoscintillators enables determination of the regions where these
   pathologies are localized with high accuracy. The procedure of
   detection of pathological organelles by this method improves
   possibilities for effective destruction of these pathologies by
   low-dose X-ray irradiation of the places of their localization. High
   effectiveness of this X-ray destruction is provided by concentrated
   absorption of X-ray quanta by the nanoscintillators and direct transfer
   of the absorbed energy to the pathological objects that are attached to
   the absorbing particles. Constructions of 3-D radiation detector
   matrices providing necessary microscopic spatial and angular
   resolutions of X-ray imaging are described on the basis of
   nanoscintillators, fiber light guides, and microcapillary matrices.

AB Temperature and frequency dependencies of the real (chi') and imaginary

   experimentally in fine particles of La-Ag manganites prepared by
   various methods. The samples under study have the Curie points in the
   range T-C = 42-48 degrees C, which is a medical hyperthermia range of
   interest. When approaching T-C from below, a critical peak of chi ''
   was revealed, followed by a steep drop while passing to the
   paramagnetic phase. The experiments on the magnetic radio-frequency
   (RF) heating of the manganite aqueous suspensions demonstrated good
   autostabilization of the temperature near T-C. Peculiar instability is
   found in the heating kinetics, caused by the observed critical behavior
   of the RF losses. The prospects of the La-Ag manganites as candidates
   for application in the temperature-controlled hyperthermia are
   discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   micro-flora. The microbial soil component actively responded to the
   addition of the polymer as an additional nutrient substrate: the latter
   was degraded and then utilized. The rate of the pesticide release to
   the soil can be regulated by varying the polymer-pesticide ratio.

AB Charge and energy fluxes onto a nanoparticle under conditions typical
   of laboratory plasmas are investigated theoretically. Here, by a
   nanoparticle is meant a grain the size of which is much smaller than
   both the electron Larmor radius and Debye length and the thermionic
   emission from which is not limited by the space charge. Under
   conditions at which thermionic emission plays an important role, the
   electric potential and temperature T (p) of a nanoparticle are
   determined by solving a self-consistent set of equations describing the
   balance of energy and charge fluxes onto the nanoparticle. It is shown
   that, when the degree of plasma ionization exceeds a critical level,
   the potential of the nanoparticle and the energy flux onto it increase
   with increasing nanoparticle temperature, so that, starting from a
   certain temperature, the nanoparticle potential becomes positive. The
   critical degree of ionization starting from which the potential of a
   nanoparticle is always positive is determined as a function of the
   plasma density and electron temperature. The nanoparticle temperature T
   (p) corresponding to the equilibrium state of a positively charged
   nanoparticle is found as a function of the electron density for
   different electron temperatures.

   excitation laser beam, which implies a two-photon absorption process.
   By focusing the 680 nm laser beam on different places in the sample, a

AB Surface-modified EuF3 nanoparticles has been produced by mixing of NaF
   and Eu(NO3)(3) aqueous solutions in the presence of sodium citrate as
   stabilizer. Transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light
   scattering has shown citric ions influence on the particle size and
   morphology. Modified and unmodified EuF3 samples were characterized by
   X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis, IR and luminescence
   spectroscopy. The results indicate that citrate ions bond chemically
   with EuF3 particle, forming a layer onto the surface. The layer
   stabilizes nanoparticle colloids and prevents their aggregation. In the
   case of modified EuF3 colloids, reversible precipitation-peptization
   processes at varying pH values and Cu2+ chemosorption by citric layer
   are revealed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB SiOx layers with lateral composition gradient (co-layers), formed by
   co-sputtering in argon plasma from Si and SiO2 targets, were
   investigated both before and after high temperature annealing using IR
   absorption and Raman scattering. For all coordinates we found more
   oxygen in the co-layers than the oxygen amount in SiO2 layers sputtered
   from quartz target only. It was found that the quartz target surface in
   the plasma heats up and this may result in oxygen and silicon monoxide
   fluxes. The capture of this additional oxygen by the silicon flux
   during co-sputtering may be the reason for the excess oxygen in the
   co-layers. For samples with low silicon content (x > 1), upon annealing
   a complete phase separation of SiOx into SiO2 and Si takes place. In
   SiOx films with high Si content some of the silicon is in the
   crystalline phase even before annealing.

AB VOx/MgO aerogel catalysts were synthesized using three different
   preparation methods: by mixing the aerogel MgO support with dry
   ammonium vanadate, by vanadium deposition from a precursor solution in
   toluene, and by hydrolysis of a mixture of vanadium and magnesium
   alkoxides followed by co-gelation and supercritical drying. The latter
   aerogel technique allowed us to synthesize mixed vanadium-magnesium
   hydroxides with the Surface areas exceeding 1300 m(2)/g. The
   synthesized catalysts were studied by a number of physicochemical
   methods (XRD, Raman spectroscopy, XANES and TEM). A common feature of
   all synthesized samples is the lack of V2O5 phase. In all cases
   vanadium was found to be a part of a surface mixed V-Mg oxide
   (magnesium vanadate), its structure depending on the synthesis method.
   The VOx/MgO mixed aerogel sample had the highest surface area 340
   m(2)/g, showed higher catalytic activity and selectivity in oxidative
   dehydrogenation of propane compared to the catalysts prepared by
   impregnation and dry mixing. The addition of iodine vapor to the feed
   in 0.1-0.25 vol.% concentrations was found to increase to propylene
   yield by 40-70%. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID CORRELATION SPECTROSCOPY; PERMEABILITY TRANSITION; LIVING CELLS;
   MECHANISM; PHOSPHORYLATION; BINDING
AB The permeant cationic dye safranine O is often used to measure
   mitochondrial membrane potential due to the dependence of both its
   absorption and fluorescence on mitochondrial energization, which causes
   its oligomerization inside mitochondria. In the present study we have
   used fluorescent correlation spectroscopy (FCS) to record the
   fluorescence changes on a micro level, i.e. under conditions permitting
   resolution of contributions from single particles (molecules of the dye
   and stained mitochondria). We have shown that the decrease in
   fluorescence signal from a suspension of energized mitochondria stained
   with a high safranine concentration (10 mu M) is explained by the
   decrease in dye concentration in the medium in parallel with the
   accumulation of the dye inside the mitochondria, which results in
   fluorescence quenching. With 1 mu M safranine O, the fluorescence rise
   after energization is caused by the accumulation of the dye up to a
   level not sufficient for full fluorescence quenching and also by the
   higher intensity of mitochondrial fluorescence on immersion of the dye
   in the hydrophobic milieu. Besides the estimation of the inner
   mitochondrial membrane potential, this approach also assesses the
   concentration of fluorescent particles. The non-monotonic dependence of
   the FCS parameter 1/G(tau -> 0) on the concentration of mitochondrial
   protein suggests heterogeneity of the system with respect to
   fluorescence of particles. An important advantage of the described
   method is its high sensitivity, which allows measurements with low
   concentrations and quantities of mitochondrial protein in samples (less
   than 10 mu g).

AB Recently great efforts are being devoted to develop new methods of
   preparation of high-disperse Pd-CeO2 containing nanosystems stabilized
   on an oxide matrix. A new approach of synthesis consists in using the
   heterometallic (Pd2Ce2IV)-Ce-II(mu-OOCMe)(12)(H2O)(2) complex as a
   precursor to anchor Pd nanoparticles on the Surface of gamma-alumina in
   direct contact with CeO2. The present work is devoted to a structural
   study of this disperse Pd-CeO2 containing nanosystem after oxidative or
   reductive pretreatments in comparison with monometallic
   alumina-supported samples by XAFS and TEM. A Strong interaction between
   Pd and ceria in the catalyst produced in the studied system affects

AB O- radical anions were observed over a partially hydroxylated MgO
   surface after illumination by monochromatic light with lambda = 280 and
   303 nm. As all corner oxygen atoms are covered with adsorbed hydroxyl
   groups after activation at 450 degrees C, this process is initiated by
   selective excitation of 3-coordinated complexes [Mg2+-O2-](3C)
   containing chemisorbed water. A new mechanism for generation of the O-
   radical anions is suggested. It is based on homolytic dissociation of
   chemisorbed water followed by migration of a hydrogen atom, probably,
   to a different nanoparticle rather than on long-distance separation of
   charges. The surface structure remaining after its detachment consists
   of an (OH)-O-center dot radical stabilized near the corner oxygen atom.
   The imminent charge transfer generates a hole at the corner oxygen atom
   stabilized by a hydroxyl group [OH-center dot center dot center dot
   Mg2+-O-](3C). DFT simulation of this structure showed that it
   reproduces the main characteristics of the radical anions O-3C(-). The
   overall structure is electrically neutral. The charge of the hole is
   compensated by the nearby hydroxyl group. So, no long-distance charge
   separation is required.

AB We study the proximity effect in a ferromagnetic nanoparticle having a
   vortex magnetization pattern. We show that for the axisymmetric system
   consisting of a circular particle and a magnetic vortex situated at the
   center of it no long-range superconducting correlations are induced. It
   means that induced superconductivity is localized in the small area
   near the superconducting electrode. However, in the real system axial
   symmetry can be broken by either a shift of the magnetic vortex from
   the origin or a geometrical anisotropy of the ferromagnetic particle.
   In this case a long-range proximity effect is possible.

AB A well-known Cluster-Cluster Aggregation (CCA) model is used for
   researching some self-organizing aggregations of colloidal
   nanoparticles. Novelty of exploration is assuming that a set of
   Shannon's information entropy maximums in the aggregate topological
   graph determines a trend of hydrosols' coagulation process, including
   integration of Ultra Dispersible Diamond (UDD). Taking under
   consideration a set of cubic-formed nanoclusters, which occupy minimal
   cubic cages of 30 x 30 x 30 and 60 x 60 x 60 cells in physical space.
   virtual nanoscale agglomerates are synthesized at different
   concentrations of clusters. Analyzing the nanosynthetics is fulfilled
   by usage the aggregate topological graphs, in which vertexes and ribs
   denote nanoclusters and their mutual bonds, respectively. It is
   revealed that decreasing of intrinsic energy (enthalpy) determines
   driving force of the agglomeration process and at the same time the
   topological information entropy is the controlling factor of the
   self-assembly morphology. Mutual correlations between porosity, fractal
   dimension, specific surface area, intrinsic energy, and topological
   information entropy of aggregates are presented. It is shown that
   theoretically minimal fractal dimension D-min = 2.21 of self-assembling
   dispersible "loose gel", is actually the same, in comparison with
   experimental value for colloidal UDD. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Thermally stable nanocrystalline films of lead sulfide PbS were

   films measured by interferometry was approximately equal to 100 nm, and
   the average particle size determined from the broadening of the X-ray
   diffraction reflections was approximately 80 nm. X-ray diffraction
   analysis revealed that annealing of the film at a temperature of 350A

   phase of the composition PbO center dot PbSO4 on the surface of the
   film. It was established that the oxide sulfate phase prevents a

   of PbS nanoparticles upon heating up to a temperature of 500A degrees

AB The initial stage of gelation of organic-inorganic hybrid hydrogels
   based on poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) and the products of hydrolytic
   polycondensation of tetramethoxysilane has been studied by capillary
   viscometry. The development of strong bonds between polymer molecules
   and silica particles in aqueous solutions is proved by the
   electrokinetic sonic amplitude method. The molecular mass of
   poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone), the concentration of starting components, and
   their total amount affect the onset time of gelation in
   poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone)-water-tetramethoxysilane systems. The general
   scheme of formation of three-dimensional networks in such systems under
   the conditions of mutual penetration of poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) coils
   is suggested. According to this scheme, nanoparticles of the general
   formula SiO (x) (OH) (y) (OR) (z) linking poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone)
   macromolecules serve as junctions of the gel network due to the
   formation of hydrogen bonds between hydrogens of silanol groups of
   organosilanes and oxygens of carbonyl groups of
   poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone).

AB Acid salts Cs (x) H3 + n - x PMo12 - n V (n) O-40 (n = 0, 1, 2, or 3; x
   = 2.5 or 3.5) with coprecipitated or supported platinum were studied
   using thermogravimetry, IR spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed
   reduction. The thermal region of the full stability of these salts is
   limited by the decomposition temperature of the corresponding acid
   H3PMo12O40 (similar to 400A degrees C) or H3 + n PMo12 - n V (n) O-40
   (similar to 300-350A degrees C). The degree of reduction of heteropoly
   anions with hydrogen is regulated by temperature. Deeply reduced
   heteropoly anions (at 300A degrees C) are slowly oxidized with oxygen
   with structure and composition regeneration. The states of molybdenum
   and vanadium on the surface of samples with coprecipitated platinum
   Pt-0.1-Cs2.5H0.5PMo12O40 (1) and Pt-0.1-Cs2.5H2.5PMo10V2O40 (2), which
   were studied using XPS, correspond to reduced or reoxidized heteropoly
   anions in the bulk. Platinum metal particles of similar to 5 nm in size
   were observed in high-resolution TEM images obtained after the
   reduction and storage of sample 1 in air. A heteropoly compound forms
   two texture levels: spherical nanoparticles of 10-20 nm in size are
   collected in closely packed globules of 100-300 nm in size. Detailed
   texture studies, which were performed using nitrogen adsorption
   isotherms, demonstrated texture mobility under the ambient conditions.
   The cesium salts of the heteropoly acids were tested in the gas-phase
   oxidation of benzene to phenol with an O-2 + H-2 mixture at 180A
   degrees. The effect of platinum concentration on the specific catalytic
   activity in the presence of deeply reduced heteropoly anions was
   monitored. The samples containing the salt Cs2.5H0.5PMo12O40 exhibited
   the highest activity in the formation of phenol. The introduction of
   vanadium into the heteropoly anion impaired the catalytic performance
   of both deeply and slightly reduced samples.

AB The conversion of n-hexane on Pt-containing dealuminated mordenites and

   determined by X-ray diffraction analysis. It was demonstrated that the
   aluminum content of the framework affected the activity in n-hexane
   isomerization. It was found that a Pt-mordenite catalyst containing a
   considerable amount of extraframework aluminum compounds exhibited
   maximum activity. A quantum-chemical study of the interaction of
   platinum with Bronsted and Lewis acid sites was performed. It was
   hypothesized that oxidized surface platinum nanoparticles were the
   active sites of Pt-containing high-silica zeolites. These nanoparticles
   were formed by the interaction of platinum clusters with proton sites
   or extraframework aluminum compounds. An alternative mechanism was
   proposed for the conversion of alkanes to exclude the direct
   participation of acid sites.

AB Atomic-level Monte Carlo simulations are performed to calculate the
   free energy, entropy, and work of nucleation for clusters of more than
   6 x 10(3) water molecules growing on silver iodide crystalline
   particles of size up to 4 nm at a temperature of 260 K. The Hamiltonian
   of the system includes explicit expressions for hydrogen bonding energy
   and Coulomb, dispersion, exchange, and polarization interactions. The
   work of nucleation exhibits complex behavior depending on the
   nucleation-site size. With increasing nanoparticle size, clusters
   become less stable and the probability of crystallization increases.
   Mutual polarization enhances the bonding between a cluster and a
   crystalline particle. Cluster growth on relatively large nanoparticles
   involves two stages characterized by two critical sizes: monolayer
   growth on the surface and growth normal to the surface. Spontaneous
   microdroplet polarization involving domain formation is found to occur
   at the crystal surface. The dependence of the ice-forming activity of
   an aerosol on particulate size observed in experiments is explained by
   combined effects of several competing factors, the dominant ones being
   the stabilizing and destabilizing effects of the nanoparticle electric
   field.

AB Using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and density
   measurements, we have studied the effect of WC particle size (20 to 150
   nm) on the optimal sintering temperature of the WC-8 wt % Co alloy and
   the effect of sintering temperature (800-1600A degrees C) on its phase
   composition, density, and microhardness. The results indicate that,
   during sintering of the starting powder mixture, the first to form is
   the ternary carbide phase Co6W6C. At sintering temperatures of 1100A
   degrees C and above, this phase reacts with carbon to form Co3W3C.
   Sintering above 1000A degrees C leads to the formation of a cubic solid
   solution of tungsten carbide in cobalt, beta-Coa OE (c) WC >, along
   with the ternary carbide phases. The density and microhardness of the
   alloy have been measured as functions of sintering temperature. The use
   of WC nanopowder has been shown to reduce the optimal sintering
   temperature of the WC-Co alloy by about 100A degrees C.

AB A series of studies of hydrocarbon oxidation by the O-2 + H-2 mixture
   in the presence of catalytic systems based on Pt or Pd and a heteropoly
   compound (HPC) is reviewed. The catalytic systems were prepared from
   Pd(II) complexes with the heteropoly tungstate anions PW11O (29) (7-)
   and PW9O (34) (9-) , the complex salt [Pt(NH3)(4)][H2Mo12O40](2) center
   dot 7H(2)O, mixtures of H2PtCl4 or H2PtCl6 with H3 + n PMo12 - n V (n)
   O-40 (n = 0-3) heteropoly acids, or supported platinum dispersed in HPC
   solutions. The interaction of metal ions and particles with HPCs in the
   initial state and after thermal and redox treatments was investigated
   by NMR, IR spectroscopy, XPS, EXAFS, HREM, and TPR. The catalytic
   systems were tested in the liquid-phase oxidation of alkanes,
   cyclohexane, cycloalkenes, benzene, toluene, and phenol with the O-2 +
   H-2 mixture at low temperatures. Effective supported catalysts based on
   platinum nanoparticles associated with the redox-active HPCs H3PMo12O40
   and H4PMo11VO40 were prepared for gas-phase benzene oxidation into
   phenol. The oxidation mechanism includes the interaction between
   dioxygen and platinum (or palladium) and the participation of the HPC
   in the formation of active oxygen species of radical nature.

AB Stable, amorphous potassium peroxystannate nanoparticles of controlled
   average size-in the range 10-100 nm-and of controlled hydrogen peroxide
   content-in the range of 19-30 wt%-were synthesized by hydrogen peroxide
   induced polymerization in water-potassium hexahydroxostannate
   solutions. The sol phase and the precipitate were characterized by
   vibrational spectroscopies, Sn-119 NMR, XPS and XRD using crystalline
   K2Sn(OH)(6) and K2Sn(OOH)(6) reference materials. This is the first
   study to show that peroxocoordination induces polymerization of a main
   group element. Sn-119 NMR studies show that peroxotin coordination and
   polymerization took place already in the hydrogen peroxide-water phase.
   The high abundance of peroxotin bonds revealed by Sn-119 MAS NMR,
   vibrational spectroscopy, and XPS suggests that the particles are
   predominantly made of peroxo bridged tin networks. Although the
   particles are highly stable in the dry phase as well as in alcohol
   solutions and do not lose hydrogen peroxide upon storage, they release
   their stored hydrogen peroxide content by exposure to water.

AB Methods of voltammetry and polarography have been applied to study
   electrochemical behavior of ultrafine copper particles with Z-average
   diameter similar to 120 nm in aqueous electrolytic media on mercury
   electrodes. Particles have been preliminarily stabilized by
   controllable passivation at low partial pressures of oxygen what
   resulted in formation of superficial oxide shell with certain
   composition and structure. It has been found that special
   electrochemical behavior of the particles in aqueous media is caused by
   the size effects as well as by the processes (partial dissolution,
   complexation) occurring at the "particle/solution" interface.
   Electroreduction of the dispersions takes place at about -0.8 V
   (Ag/AgCl/KCl sat.). The mechanism of electroreduction includes an
   adsorption stage due to electric charge which the particles bear in the
   electrolyte. The particle adsorption on the electrode has been shown by
   differential capacity measurements, the surface charge in different
   electrolytes was estimated by means of potentiometric titration of the
   dispersions. The sign of the charge and the probable electroactive
   species formed by partial dissolution of CuO and Cu2O in the
   electrolytic medium have been considered on basis of equilibria at the
   copper particle/dispersion interface. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   small-angle X-ray scattering. The size distributions of inhomogeneities
   in the porous structure of the cellulose matrix and the size
   distributions of silver nanoparticles in the composite have been
   determined. It is shown that the sizes of synthesized nanoparticles
   correlate with the sizes of inhomogeneities in the gel film. Particles
   of larger size (with radii up to 100 nm) have also been found. Electron
   microscopy of thin cross sections of a dried composite layer showed
   that large particles are located on the cellulose layer surface.
   Electron diffraction revealed a crystal structure of silver
   nanoparticles in the composite.

AB The interference of guiding polariton modes propagating through the

   "traffic" circle docked by two linear entrance and exit chains is
   investigated. The dependence of intensity of the polariton wave on the
   position of the particle on the circle was studied using the
   multisphere Mie scattering formalism. We show that, if the frequency of
   light belongs to the pass-band of the circular part of this waveguide,
   the electromagnetic waves may be considered as two optical beams
   running along the circle in opposite directions and interfering with
   each other. Indeed, the obtained intensity behavior can be represented
   as a simple superposition of two waves propagating along the circle in
   opposite directions. The applications of this interference are
   discussed. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The specifics of X-ray-induced reduction of copper(II) ions in the
   polyacrylic acid-polyethyleneimine-copper(II) (PAA-PEI-Cu2+) complexes
   were studied. It was found that the action of radiation led to the
   effective reduction of Cu2+ in the PAA-PEI-Cu2+ films swollen in an
   aqueous-alcohol medium. The formation of metal nanoparticles in
   irradiated samples was revealed by electron microscopy and X-ray
   diffraction techniques. Analysis of ESR data has demonstrated that the
   Cu2+ reduction rate increases with an increase in the initial
   concentration of copper ions in the samples. Formal yields of the
   radiation-chemical reduction of Cu2+ in the PAA-PEI complex films were
   found to be quite high (> 100 ions per100 eV of energy absorbed by the
   swollen film), which can be explained by involvement of the radiolysis
   products of aqueous alcoholic solutions (outer medium) in the reduction
   processes.

AB In the present work, nanocatalysts prepared on inorganic supports
   (zeolites) were investigated in d-glucose oxidation and compared to
   systems supported on polymer (hypercrosslinked polystyrene (HPS))
   previously described. Catalytic activities and selectivities were
   measured under various reaction conditions. The selectivity of
   d-glucose oxidation and activity of both Pd-containing zeolites and
   HPS-Ru were similar (99.7% and TOF 0.013-0.014 mol/(mol Me s)).
   Physicochemical analysis X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, liquid
   nitrogen physisorption, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform
   spectroscopy of adsorbed CO for metal sites evaluation, CD3CN for acid
   sites evaluation showed that Pd species were in oxidic form, while Ru
   species were in oxidic and reduced form. The catalytic activity
   decreased when acidic sites were present in Pd-containing zeolites.

AB The process of aggregation of conjugates of dextran hydrophobically
   modified by sterically hindered phenols in an aqueous medium was
   studied by dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy,
   atomic force microscopy, and fluorescent spectroscopy. It was found
   that, in solutions of dextran and related conjugates, individual
   molecules and their aggregates are present. The concentration, size,
   and shape of aggregates, as well as aggregation number, are determined
   by the degree of substitution of glycoside groups of dextran. It was
   shown that the critical concentration of conjugate aggregation
   decreases as the degree of substitution of dextran molecules increases.

AB Prolonged (up to 2 h) heat treatment at 1600 degrees C of nanodiamond
   particles (5 nm) leads to their conversion to the mixture of
   quasi-spherical carbon onions and multi-shell polyhedral nanographites.
   Structural and magnetic properties of two (A and B) series of
   nanographite samples obtained at various annealing intervals were
   studied. XRD data show that both multi-shell nanographite samples have
   practically the same crystalline structures. HRTEM evidences that the
   most of particles obtained by short time (7 min) annealing have a
   spherical like shape whereas the long time (similar to 2 h) annealing
   leads to the majority of particles having a polyhedral shape with a
   hollow inside. Electronic and magnetic properties of these nanocarbons
   were investigated by magnetic susceptibility and EPR. Annealing results
   in entire transformation of the EPR signal of nanodiamond to new EPR
   signals of various line shapes and widths. These signals are extremely
   sensitive to ambient oxygen. Concentrations for all EPR active spins
   vary from similar to 1 x 10(19) spins/g (7 min) to similar to 2 x
   10(19) spins/g (2 h). Temperature dependences of EPR spectra'
   parameters were obtained for vacuum-processed samples within the range
   4-600 K. Intensity vs. T plots may be well-fitted by the combination of
   Curie-Weiss and temperature-independent Pauli susceptibility
   contributions. The latter one increases on heat treatment. Significant
   extension of electron spin-lattice relaxation time on decreasing
   temperature was found. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The effect of electron beam pretreatment of fused silica glass upon its
   surface functional composition and possibility for subsequent
   immobilization of methacryloxypropyl-trimethoxysilane (MOPTMS) layer is
   studied using FTIR spectroscopy and adsorption of acid-base indicators.
   The content of Brensted acidic centers (silanol groups) on the
   irradiated fused silica surface is found to follow an "oscillatory''
   trend as function of the absorbed dose below 100 kGy at electron beam
   processing due to the alternating reactions of hydroxylation (probably
   as a result of Si-O-Si bond disruption and interaction with radiolyzed
   physically adsorbed water) and thermal dehydration/dehydroxylation at
   radiation heating. The best conditions for MOPTMS layer formation are
   based on the increased acidity of both silica surface (formation of
   acidic hydroxyls) and the reaction medium (MOPTMS deposition from
   acetic acid solution). The optimal value of absorbed dose at electron
   beam processing providing the highest efficiency of MOPTMS grafting is
   50 kGy at accelerated electron energy 700 keV. Electron beam
   pretreatment of fused silica surface is shown to provide more efficient
   MOPTMS immobilization in comparison with conventional chemical and
   thermal grafting procedures. The obtained results are promising for the
   enhancement of the processes for the production of fused silica glass
   capillaries for electrochromatography and electrophoresis at the stage
   of an intermediate bifunctional layer formation required for the
   subsequent deposition of specific polymer coatings. (C) 2009 Elsevier

   are allowed energy bands produced by surface defects. Two-particle
   states (electron-hole pairs) are only slightly confined, and the
   size-quantized states of charge carriers are formed in the conduction
   band; the states depend on the shape and dimensions of the
   nanoparticles. By the example of Al2O3 nanoparticles introduced into a
   liquid matrix of a transparent insulator, the results of experimental
   studies are compared with the theoretical model.

   substantially coated the surfaces of the bacteria, It was found that
   the decorated cells had it 56% higher DBT desulfurization activity in
   basic salt medium (BSM) compared to the nondecorated cells. We propose
   that this is due to permeabilization of the bacterial membrane,
   facilitating the entry and exit of reactant and product, respectively.
   Model experiments with black lipid membranes (BLM) demonstrated that

AB The Co/CaF2/Si(001) heterostructures with the corrugated (110) surface
   of the CaF2 buffer layer have been grown by molecular beam epitaxy. The
   structures are nanoparticle arrays of single-crystal Co, mostly of the
   cubic fcc modification. The behavior of the magnetic hysteresis loops
   as a function of the density of coverage of the substrate by cobalt
   islands, the island size, and the temperature is studied using the
   magnetooptical technique. At low coverage densities, where the
   effective cobalt film thickness d(eff) is less than the critical value
   d(eff)(c), the magnetic structure of the films at T = 294 K can be
   visualized as an ensemble of superparamagnetic, weakly interacting
   nanoparticles and is characterized by small values of the coercive
   field H-c and the remanent magnetization M-rem. A decrease in the
   temperature leads to a strong increase in H-c and M-rem, which is
   associated with the transition of the islands to the blocked state. The
   blocking temperature of the structures is T-b similar to 280 K. The
   magnetic anisotropy parameter K and the saturation magnetization M-s of
   the islands depend on the growth temperature of cobalt T-Co. An
   increase in the coverage density above the critical thickness d(eff)(c)
   at T = 294 K brings about a strong increase in H-c and M-rem and the
   appearance of a hysteresis loop anisotropy originating from the
   corrugated structure of the CaF2 buffer layer. The experimental results
   are compared with the model of an ensemble of noninteracting
   superparamagnetic particles.

AB A novel approach of colorimetric quantification of chitosan based on
   the derivatization reaction of its primary amino groups with
   o-phthalaldehyde and a thiol - N-acetyl-L-cysteine has been developed.
   The reaction of equal volumes of sample solution and the reagent
   solution was allowed to proceed for 1 h, and then the absorbance values
   were measured at 340 nm against the reference solution. The procedure
   conditions have been optimized for chitosan assay in the presence of
   polyanionic electrolyte dextran sulphate (pH 8.9, the reagent solution:
   4.0 mM o-phthalaldehyde. 2.6 mM N-acetyl-L-cysteine, 0.25 M NaCl). The
   method has proven to be convenient and reliable for quantitative
   determination of either the concentrations of chitosans of various
   molecular weights or their degree of deacetylation. The different
   reactivity of chitosans and proteins can be used in order to determine
   chitosan in presence of the protein. This approach ensured accurate
   assay within the chitosan concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 0.15
   mg/ml and could be applied for quantitative analysis of chitosan in
   protein-loaded microparticles. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Density functional theory (DFT) was applied to investigate the
   structure and reactivity of Pt-6 particles encapsulated in silicalite
   as well as in sodium and hydrogen ZSM-5 zeolites. Incorporation of a
   metal particle in silicalite or sodium zeolite leads to the formation
   of a negatively charged metal cluster with stabilization energies close
   to 9 and 16 kcal/mol, respectively. Interaction of a platinum cluster
   with hydrogen zeolite and extra-framework aluminum species is
   characterized by energies as high as 4550 kcal/mol and yields an
   electron-deficient metal particle. This positively charged metal
   cluster stabilized in the zeolite channel can function as active site
   in alkane transformations. The formation of the active site is
   accompanied by suppression of both Bronsted and Lewis acidities. An
   alternative mechanism of alkane cracking and isomerization avoiding the
   direct participation of acid sites has been proposed. (c) 2008 Elsevier

AB The features of the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis in the presence of 100Fe
   : 8A(l)2O(3) : 3K(2)O (parts by weight) catalyst nanoparticles under
   the slurry reactor conditions have been studied. The catalyst is
   prepared in situ and activated in the reactor. It has been found that
   during the preparation process, the catalyst reacts with the dispersion
   medium to form a structured system that is not liable to sedimentation.
   It is shown that the use of CO as a reducing agent makes it possible to
   increase the yield of liquid hydrocarbons by a factor of 1.5. An
   increase in the syngas pressure has almost no effect on the yield of
   liquid hydrocarbons; however, it gives the possibility of enhancing the
   catalyst efficiency up to 700 g/(kg Fe . h) at 40 atm. In conditions of
   a three-phase system, gasoline-fraction hydrocarbons, half of which
   consist of olefins, are mostly formed on the nanosized catalyst.

   Under certain conditions, the efficiency of a nanocatalyst can achieve
   5 kg/(kg cat h), which is an order of magnitude higher than that of
   conventional catalyst systems.

AB At present, the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) is the most popular
   technique to simulate optical responses from various nanoparticles,
   including gold nanorods with a complex morphology. However, the DDA
   code demands considerable computer resources and computation time if
   one needs orientation and ensemble averaging. Here, we introduce a new
   T-matrix-solvable and flexible geometrical model for nanorods that can
   be implemented on a usual office PC to calculate the optical properties
   of a statistical nanorod ensemble with random orientations. The model
   is used for accurate calculations of the orientation-averaged
   extinction spectra for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) based
   ensembles of gold nanorods with account taken of statistical variations
   in their shape and size. The simulated spectra are in good agreement
   with experimental measurements provided that the surface electron
   scattering constant A(s) is about 0.3. Our ensemble-based estimation of
   the surface-scattering constant is close to A(s) evaluations from
   single-rod scattering (Novo et al. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2006, 8,
   3540-3546) and single-sphere absorption (Berciaud et al. Nano Lett.
   2005, 5, 515-518) experiments.

   Size-and shape-controlled synthetic procedures were developed to
   prepare nanostructured Pd and Ni particles in high yields from easily
   available precursors. The presence of the non-metallic functional
   groups in the particle's core forced the metal centers to adopt a
   divalent oxidation state bearing polar chemical bonds ("nanosalt"). The
   Pd and Ni particles were excellent catalysts to accomplish a highly
   selective synthetic route to vinyl chalcogenides. The mechanisms of the
   catalytic reactions via the heterogeneous and homogeneous pathways were
   revealed and studied in detail.

AB Bioaffine methods were developed for determining indole-containing
   alkaloids ajmaline and vincristine. These methods are based on the
   proposed amperometric DNA-sensors and on immunoenzyme test-system with
   a spectrophotometric indication of the analytical signal. The
   complexing between ajmaline and immobilized native DNA (n-IDNA) allows
   effective preliminary concentration from test solutions on the
   biosensor. The time of analysis is 25-30 min, limit of detection (LOD)
   for ajmaline is 1.0 x 10(-10) M. The test-system utilized the
   immunological reaction of ajmaline with its antibodies and the enzyme
   marker, horseradish peroxidase, LOD is 1.5 x 10(-9) M. Anti-cancer
   vincristine interaction with immobilized renatured DNA (r-IDNA) was
   studied and determination was carried out using an amperometric
   DNA-sensor. Bioaffine membrane drug concentration and reactivation of
   the sensor was performed. The affinity binding constant K-bind for
   vincristine-r-IDNA complex calculated by Scatchard's method was found
   to be high enough [(5.0 +/- 0.4) x 10(5) l/mol] confirming high
   specificity of the complexing with r-IDNA. The duration of the assay is
   40 min. The developed method is characterized with an LOD of 1.1 x
   10(-9) M, with the lack of the need for long sample processing. The
   pharmaceuticals were determined by those methods in model solutions of
   blood serum and in tablets and solutions for injections.

AB We report the fabrication of an amperometric whole-cell herbicide
   biosensor based on magnetic retention of living cells functionalised
   with magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) on the surface of a screen-printed
   electrode. We demonstrate that Chlorella pyrenoidosa microalgae cells
   coated with biocompatible MNPs and retained on the electrode with a
   permanent magnet act as a sensing element for the fast detection of
   herbicides. The magnetic functionalisation does not affect the
   viability and photosynthesis activity-mediated triazine herbicide
   recognition in microalgae. The current of ferricyanide ion was recorded
   during alternating illumination periods and biosensor fabricated was
   used to detect atrazine (from 0.9 to 74 mu M) and propazine (from 0.6
   to 120 mu M) (the limits of detection 0.7 and 0.4 mu M, respectively).
   We believe that the methodology presented here can be widely used in
   fabrication of a number of whole cell biosensors since it allows for
   efficient and reversible cells immobilisation and does not affect the
   cellular metabolism.
