AB The mesostructure of amorphous xerogels based on hydrated zirconia ZrO2
   and its evolution at different stages of heat treatment have been
   investigated using the small-angle neutron scattering method. A
   correlation function of the nuclear scattering amplitude density has
   been obtained from experimental neutron scattering cross sections, and
   the characteristic radii of ZrO2 nanoparticles and their specific
   surface areas have been determined. The influence of the annealing
   temperature on the fractal properties of the zirconia surface has been
   elucidated.

ID MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS
AB Data on quasi-elastic neutron scattering by a water dispersion of
   nanodiamonds and a pure water as a supporting system has been analyzed.
   The observed difference in the quasi-elastic neutron scattering spectra
   is interpreted using two different approaches developed to date for
   describing the behavior of a solvent in the cases of low and moderate
   concentrations of carbon nanoparticles (for example, fullerenes,
   nanotubes, ultradispersed diamonds). Within the first approach, it is
   assumed that the influence of dissolved nanoparticles leads to an
   insignificant change in the properties of the solvent. Within the
   second approach, the properties of the solvent are assumed to be
   invariable as compared to those of the pure liquid, except for a narrow
   boundary region of the order of two to three atomic layers near the
   surface of nanoparticles, where the properties of the solvent change
   drastically. The explanation of the effect within the second approach
   seems to be more reliable despite the apparent complication of the
   mathematical treatment of the experiment.

SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS

   APPROXIMATION; CERAMICS; MODELS; QUARTZ; MEDIA
AB The obtained spectroscopic data for absorption and scattering
   characteristics of nanoporous silica in the wavelength range from 0.25
   to 7 mu m are analyzed on the basis of the Mie theory. It is shown that
   aggregates of primary nanoparticles are responsible for relatively high
   scattering in the short-wave range from 0.25 to 1.4 mu m. But the
   presence of the aggregates and micron-size cracks in the samples cannot
   explain unusual behavior of scattering in the long-wave part of the
   spectral range. The attention of the authors is focused on
   understanding of strong scattering peaks observed at exactly the same
   wavelengths as the infrared absorption peaks of bulk silica: at lambda
   = 2.9, 5.3, and 6.1 mu m. The known physical effect of "scattering by
   absorption" is considered as a source of these scattering peaks. It
   means that absorption centers are assumed to be not uniformly
   distributed in the nanoporous matrix but collected in some micron-size
   regions. The estimates based on this hypothesis are supported by the
   fact that near-infrared absorption peaks are produced by silanol groups
   which may be nonuniformly distributed in the hydroxylated nanoporous
   silica. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics. [doi: 10.1063/1.3374473]

   of vapor molecules to the hydration shells of ions, as well as the data
   of quantum- chemical calculations for stable cluster configurations and
   the vibration frequency of interionic bonds. The allowance for
   many-particle interactions makes it possible to improve the agreement
   between experimental and quantum-chemical data by more than an order of
   magnitude. The disregard for many-particle interactions leads to the

AB It is shown that nonstoichiometric interpolymer complexes composed of
   high-molecular-mass poly(acrylic acid) and PEG of various molecular
   masses are more efficient stabilizers of copper sols than each
   component of the complex taken separately. This conclusion is based on
   comparison of dimensions of copper nanoparticles in sols formed via
   reduction of copper(II) ions in solutions of poly(acrylic acid), PEG,
   and their blends and on the enhanced stability of sols protected by the
   interpolymer complex against aggregation and oxidation of metal
   particles. Much shorter PEG chains than those necessary for formation
   of corresponding interpolymer complexes in the absence of nanoparticles
   can be involved in formation of tertiary complexes including copper
   nanoparticles, poly(acrylic acid), and PEG. On the basis of the
   experimental data, it is inferred that the mutual enhancement of the
   complexing behavior of components occurs in tertiary complexes
   containing copper nanoparticles and both polymers.

   investigated using Mossbauer spectroscopy. It has been revealed that
   the state of iron depends on the nature of the support. Iron(III)
   hydroxysulfate and iron(III) oxysulfate nanoparticles are formed on the
   surface of silica gel, and iron oxide nanoparticles are formed on the
   surface of aluminum oxide. An increase in the concentration of iron
   ions or in the size of iron-containing particles leads to hydration of
   the nanoparticle surface. The calcination of the samples results in the
   formation of E >-Fe2O3 oxide in a strongly disordered or amorphous

AB Hematological parameters and the state of liver cells of rats were
   examined in vivo after the animals received aflatoxin B-1 (AfB(1))
   alone and together with modified nanodiamonds (MND) synthesized by
   detonation. The rats that had received the MND hydrosol had elevated
   leukocyte levels, mainly due to higher granulocyte counts and somewhat
   increased monocyte counts compared to control rats. Hematological
   parameters of the rats that had received AfB(1) alone differed from
   those of the control rats in another way: total white blood cell counts
   were significantly lower due to the decreased lymphocyte counts. In
   rats that had consumed AfB(1) with the MND hydrosol, changes in
   hematological parameters were less pronounced than in rats that had
   consumed either AfB(1) or MND. Electron microscopy showed that
   hepatocytes of the rats that had received the MND hydrosol or AfB(1)
   with the MND hydrosol contained elevated levels of lipid inclusions and
   lysosomes. Hyperplasia of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (EPR) was
   revealed in liver specimens of the rats that had received AfB(1).
   Results of the study suggest the conclusion about mutual mitigation of
   the effects of nanoparticles and the mycotoxin on rats blood and liver
   cells after AfB(1) has adsorbed on MND.

AB The dependence of nanoparticle size distributions on laser intensity
   profile was determined during infrared femtosecond laser ablation of
   silver targets in air. Laser parameters were adjusted to ablate at the
   same peak fluence with spatially homogeneous (Hat-top) and
   inhomogeneous (Gaussian) intensity distributions formed by diffractive
   optical elements. Aerodynamic particle size was measured online by an
   electric low-pressure cascade impactor. Narrower size distributions
   were detected for the flat-top intensity profile in the fluence range
   from 0.6 to 4.4 J/cm(2), while the Gaussian beam produced broad and
   bimodal distributions. The aerodynamic number frequency of the primary
   nanoparticulate fraction (40 nm) was equal to the number frequency of
   the submicron agglomerate fraction (200 urn) at laser fluence of 1
   J/cm(2). The Feret diameter of primary particles was 80 nm. Geometrical
   interpretation of the irradiated spots at the corresponding laser
   fluence regimes explains the formation of lit nodal (submicron and
   nanoparticulate) size distribution M the case of Gaussian beams. The
   bimodality is attributed to different thermalization path ways during
   laser ablation.

AB The formation of the nanocrystalline rocksalt ZnO (rs-ZnO) has been in
   situ studied by x-ray diffraction with synchrotron radiation at high
   pressure and high temperature. A number of rs-ZnO/MgO nanocomposites
   with preset grain size were synthesized at 7 GPa and 800 K starting
   from wurtzite ZnO nanoparticles or nanorods. The use of MgO matrix
   allowed us to recover metastable rs-ZnO in the nanocrystalline form at
   ambient pressure. The cathodoluminescence measurements demonstrated the
   blue shift in the luminescence of rs-ZnO nanocrystals down to 402-408
   nm that can be attributed to the enhanced incorporation of point
   defects with lower activation energy. (C) 2010 American Institute of

AB The formation of nanocrystalline calcium carbonate phosphates doped
   with Fe2+, Mg-2, Zn2+, K+, Si4+, and Mn2+ has been studied by X-ray
   diffraction, IR spectroscopy, differential thermal analysis, and energy
   dispersive X-ray fluorescence analysis. The results indicate that the
   synthesis involves the formation of hydroxy carbonate complexes from
   the three calcium carbonate polymorphs (calcite, vaterite, and
   aragonite) in a solution of ammonium chloride and ammonium carbonate,
   followed by reaction with orthophosphoric acid. This ensures the
   preparation of a bioactive material based on chlorophosphates,
   octacalcium hydrogen phosphate, and calcium chloride hydroxide
   phosphates containing cation vacancies. Particle-size analysis data
   show that the materials contain nanoparticles down to 10 nm in size.
   Heat treatment of the doped calcium carbonate phosphates produces
   calcium hydroxyapatite containing cation vacancies, which can be used
   as a bioactive ceramic.

   An increase in IR-irradiation intensity leads to the formation of

AB Analytical and numerical methods have been used to study the ground
   state of magnetization of a nanowire consisting of ferromagnetic
   crystallites that are coupled via exchange interactions. The random
   nature of the field of crystallographic anisotropy has been taken into
   account. It is shown that the magnetization of a nanowire is divided
   into weakly interacting regions of magnetization called blocks. Such
   characteristics, as the average size of a magnetic block, its effective
   anisotropy constant, and their dependence on the size of crystallites
   have been calculated analytically and simulated numerically in a
   two-angle approximation. The coordinate dependences of the
   magnetization dispersion at the edge and in the bulk of the magnet have
   been determined. It is shown that the functional dependence of the
   dispersion on the coordinate changes with moving away from the free
   edge of the nanowire.

AB The main aim of this paper is the theoretical and experimental study of
   the dielectric characteristics of composite materials based on porous
   non-organic glasses containing metal nanoparticles. Dielectric
   properties of the materials were investigated using a Broad Band
   Dielectric Spectrometer (NOVOCONTROL BDS 80) over wide frequency
   (0.1-10(5) Hz) and temperature (-120 to 300 degrees C) ranges. For a
   description of dielectric response of such composite materials, a
   non-phenomenological model has been proposed based on the hopping of
   electrons between glass traps around the metal nanoparticles. The model
   provided an insight into the dependence of the dielectric properties of
   the nanocomposites, depending on nature and concentration of
   nanoparticles, their size distribution, temperature dependence and type
   of matrix. The results of the model demonstrate the physically
   justified features. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The microstructure of the porous Cr-Al metal-oxide cermet was studied

   cermet was synthesized by mechanical alloying of Cr-Al powders in an
   AGO-2 planetary ball mill followed by hydrothermal treatment in a
   special stainless steel die and calcination in air. As a result, a
   highly porous monolith comprised of metal-like particles randomly
   distributed in the oxide matrix (Cr2O3 and Al2O3) was formed. Two types
   of the composite cores were found in cermets. The first one consisted
   of chromium phase containing nanoparticles sized from 50 to 140 nm and
   Al-enriched phase at the interfaces. The second one consisted of new
   chromium oxide phases with hexagonal Cr2N-like and fcc CrN-like
   structures probably with Cr2O and CrO stoichiometry. These new phases
   were stabilized within aggregates of the nanocomposite particles
   containing inclusions of alumina. The relations between different
   preparation stages and the cermet microstructure are discussed.

AB The experimental data on the aluminum nanopowders (nAl) combustion in
   oxidizing media (air, propellants AP/HTPB/Al/HMX and energetic
   compositions) assuming the phenomenon of nitrides formation with the
   high yield is generalizes. In the present work the nAl, produced by
   electrical explosion of wires, was studied. The temperature, burning
   rate and radiation were measured at combustion and the actual burning
   process was recorded by a video camera. Scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and chemical analysis were performed on
   the both initial powders and final condensed products. It was
   experimentally proved that combustion process of aluminum nanoparticles
   was two staged independently of burning condition in nitrogen-contained
   media. The formation of nitrides in presence of molecular nitrogen is
   the determining stage in the particles combustion. A qualitative
   discussion is given on the kinetic limitation for AlN (AlON) oxidation
   due to rapid condensation and encapsulation of solid AlN (AlON).

   photoelectron spectra of nanoscale Au-S products formed via the
   reduction of aqueous HAuCl4 by sulfide ions and immobilized onto

   formation of predominant polysulfide species and metallic gold, while
   the transmission spectra showed Au-S bonding, the share of which
   increased with increasing molar Na2S/HAuCl4 ratio in the reaction
   solution. The Au-S distances derived from EXAFS analysis changes from
   2.31 angstrom to 2.325 angstrom with the concentration of sodium

AB Modification of polymer properties by incorporation of nanoparticles is
   a way for the development of advanced membrane materials. New materials
   based on the compositions polymer fullerene were developed for the use
   in pervaporation. Two polymers polyphenylene oxide (PPO) and
   polyphenylene isophtalamide (PA) were modified by fullerene C-60. Their
   transport properties were studied in pervaporation of two systems: the
   reacting mixture ethanol acetic acid water ethyl acetate by
   fullerene-containing PPO membranes and the methanol/cyclohexane mixture
   with azeotropic point by fullerene-containing PA membranes. The
   experimental study of sorption-diffusion parameters were carried out in
   sorption tests to analyze transport properties of the modified
   membranes as a function of the fullerene content in membranes.

AB The thermodynamic and kinetic regularities of the formation of
   inorganic nanoparticles in solutions containing additives of highly
   adsorbable organic compounds were examined. The dependences of the
   surface tension on the nanoparticle size and surface coverage and of
   the size dependences of the rate constants of all reactions were taken
   into account. A kinetic equation describing the formation of
   nanoparticles was derived, important limiting cases considered, and
   simplified analytical solutions obtained. It was demonstrated that, at
   the initial stage, the nanoparticle grows linearly with time, whereas
   at later stages (large nano-particle radii) and high intensity of
   organic compound adsorption, it grows in the formation regime. The
   properties of size distribution function of nanoparticles under
   steady-state conditions are analyzed. It was shown that the presence of
   a highly adsorbable organic compound in the solution substantially
   diminishes the variation of nanoparticles in size and makes them
   smaller.

AB Silver-containing nanocomposites were prepared by impregnating Vycor
   glass (a pore diameter of 4 nm) and synthesized opal matrices (an
   interstitial void size of 40 nm) with cyclooctadiene complex of silver
   hexafluoroacetylacetonate (Ag(hfac)COD), a silver precursor, dissolved
   in supercritical carbon dioxide and were examined by optical absorption
   spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and electron spin-resonance
   spectroscopy. It was demonstrated that the absorption spectra of Vycor
   glass and opal matrices impregnated with Ag(hfac) COD molecules and
   subjected to thermal treatment in air at temperatures above 50 degrees
   C exhibit plasmon resonances characteristic of Ag nanoparticles at
   420-430 nm. The peculiarities of the plasmon resonance band for both
   types of samples were attributed to the morphology of the pore space in
   which silver particles are formed. Paramagnetic Cu(hfac)(2) molecules
   (copper hexafluoroacetylacetonate) were used as a spectroscopic probe
   for estimating the distribution of the precursor in the pores of Vycor

AB The possibility of using unique properties of lanthanides in the
   nanotechnology is demonstrated. The origination of linear and nonlinear
   optical properties of lanthanide compounds with phthalocyanines,
   porphyrins, naphthalocyanines, and their analogs in solutions and
   condensed state and the prospects of obtaining novel materials on their
   basis are discussed. Based on the electronic structure and properties
   of lanthanides and their compounds, namely, optical and magnetic
   characteristics, electronic and ionic conductivity, and fluctuating
   valence, molecular engines are classified. High-speed storage engines
   or memory storage engines; photoconversion molecular engines based on
   Ln(II) and Ln(III); electrochemical molecular engines involving
   silicate and phosphate glasses; molecular engines whose operation is
   based on insulatorsemiconductor, semiconductor-metal, and
   metal-superconductor types of conductivity phase transitions; solid
   electrolyte molecular engines; and miniaturized molecular engines for
   medical analysis are distinguished. It is shown that thermodynamically
   stable nanoparticles of Ln (x) M (y) composition can be formed by d
   elements of the second halves of the series, i.e., those arranged after
   M = Mn, Tc, and Re. Prospects of using lanthanide superconductors in

   catalysts synthesized at the laboratory, is studied in sulfuric and
   perchloric acid solutions. It is shown that on a monopalladium
   catalyst, the first inhibiting factor prevails, whereas, on a
   monoplatinum catalyst, a substantial role in decelerating the reaction
   is played by the adsorption of HS anions. In the case of a trimetal
   catalyst, the adsorption curve of oxygen-containing species is
   noticeably shifted toward the curve typical of platinum. When
   perchloric acid is replaced with sulfuric acid, the potential of the
   kink point of the Tafel dependence of the oxygen electroreduction (on
   going from the low to high polarization) is shifted toward the less
   positive potentials. This shift of the kink potential is most clearly
   pronounced in the case of a monoplatinum catalyst.

   type of die precursor and its concentration, hi the current paper, the
   mechanism of the reactions of ZnO and/or Zn formation was proposed.
   Longer plasma irradiation and lower precursor concentration favor the
   fabrication of metallic Zn nanoparticles. The nature of the precursor's
   ion (acetate, nitrate, or chloride) is also of importance in
   determining the composition of the product. The glass slides coated by

ID MAGNETIC-RESONANCE CRYOPOROMETRY
AB Gel films of Acetobacter Xylinum cellulose and its modified samples
   have been investigated by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
   cryoporometry and small-angle X-ray scattering. The joint use of these
   two methods made it possible to characterize the sizes of aqueous pores
   in gel films and estimate the sizes of structural inhomogeneities
   before and after the sorption of polyvinylpyrrolidone and Se-0
   nanoparticles (stabilized by polyvinylpyrrolidone) into the films.
   According to small-angle X-ray scattering data, the sizes of
   inhomogeneities in a gel film change only slightly upon the sorption of
   polyvinylpyrrolidone and nanoparticles. The impregnated material is

AB The plasmon-exciton interaction in composite nanoparticles consisting
   of a metal (Au) core coated with two layers of organic materials, i.e.,
   a monomolecular dielectric interlayer and a layer of cyanine dye
   J-aggregate was studied. In contrast to previously studied systems,
   metal in nanoobjects under consideration is at a distance of 1.2 nm
   from the J-aggregate, which allows maintaining the interaction of metal
   plasmons and J-aggregate excitons and weakening luminescence quenching
   at the same time. The particle morphology was studied by transmission
   electron and atomic-force microscopy. Bands caused by the dye
   J-aggregate formation on the surface were detected in the absorption
   spectrum of such particles. Fast dynamics (several picoseconds) of
   optical density variation was detected by the pump-probe method. The
   photoluminescence spectrum contains a narrowband characteristic of
   J-aggregates, which is excited due to a locally strengthened field of
   metal core plasmons.

AB Two series of silicon-based self-forming nanospheres were fabricated in
   an inductive vaporizer-condenser under different processing parameters
   and characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopy,
   X-ray diffraction and optical spectroscopy. Although nanoparticles of
   both series acquired practically identical spherical morphology and
   size range (from 5 to 250 nm), their structure and phase composition
   were completely different. The nanospheres of the first series were
   composed of amorphous silica, whereas those of the second one were
   composed of a crystalline silicon core covered with a thin shell of
   silica. This core-shell structure exhibited extremely low transmittance
   of UV radiation which indicates that the nanosphere has potential
   application as an active sunscreen component. Moreover, being known as
   biologically inert and harmless for the human organism, silicon-silica
   core shell nanostructures could be considered as a subject for
   biomedical technologies utilizing the unique physical properties of
   silicon confined to nanosize and protected by an oxide shell.

   transition from a ferromagnetic temperature dependence to an
   antiferromagnetic temperature dependence has been observed in nanorods
   and nanotubes with a decrease in the temperature. The FM-AFM crossover
   observed near T-C similar to 110 K is accompanied by a low-temperature
   increase in the Curie constant by a factor of 2.7-7. The comparison of
   the experimental data for various VOx nanoparticles indicates that the
   most probable cause of the change in the type of magnetic interaction
   is a change in the concentration of V4+ magnetic ions.

AB The effect of homogeneously distributed nanosized (1...8 nm) particles
   of gamma'- and Fe-rich phases on the evolution of vacancy defects in
   electron irradiated Fe-Ni-Al alloy was investigated by positron
   annihilation spectroscopy. It was shown that presence of precipitates
   in an alloy leads to decrease in accumulation of vacancies several
   times in comparison with an alloy quenched on a solid solution. Thus
   the size of this effect strongly depends on density, the size of
   particles, and also their type. The effect of nanoparticles increases
   when the irradiation temperature increases. The irradiation-induced
   nucleation of intermetallic particles like Ni3Al was also observed in a
   quenched on a solid solution and preliminary aged at 1023 K alloys
   under irradiation at 573 K. Possible mechanisms of influence of
   precipitates on behavior of vacancy defects are discussed.

AB The composite silver and gold nanoparticles (AgNPs and AuNPs) coated
   with nonionic amphiphilic block copolymers (Pluronics L121, F68, or
   F127) are prepared by their adsorption under critical micelle
   concentrations. It is found that Pluronics bind to the surface of metal
   NPs as a very thin film by the hydrophobic association through
   polypropylene oxide) block of the copolymers. The modification
   increases the colloidal stability of NPs with increasing
   hydrophilic-lipopltilic balance of Pluronics in the order of L121,
   F127, and F68. In order to investigate the potentials of polymer coated
   noble metal NPs as surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) probes,
   fluorescent dyes and doxorubicin are used as model compounds. IL is
   found that Pluronic component promotes the adsorption of these
   compounds on the composite NPs resulting in a considerable increase of
   Raman signal. This effect is attributed to increased concentration of
   the analyte molecules on the composite surface due to the hydrophobic
   and charge-charge interactions between the analytes and the Pluronic
   coat, and the stabilization of NPs by poly(ethylene oxide) blocks. The
   copolymer coated AgNPs show higher SERS activity than the counterparts
   prepared with AuNPs. Among the prepared composites, the AgNPs modified
   with Pluronic F127 containing extended poly(propylene oxide) and
   poly(ethylene oxide) blocks exhibit maximal Raman activity using
   rhodamine 6G (Rh6G) with a EF of 9.04 x 10(6). The results show that
   the developed Pluronic-based SERS probes can be used for sensitive and
   selective analysis of organic analytes.

AB Colloids of metal nanoparticles (NPs) of Au, Ag, Pd, and Pt protected
   by natural polymer arabinogalactan (ARB) extracted from Larix sibirica
   were studied. The nanocomposites were prepared by reduction of metal
   salts in the water Solutions of ARB. We carried out dynamic (DLS) and
   static light scattering resonantly enhanced by the NP plasmons. The
   translational diffusion was examined via DLS and I polarized
   interferometer. The virgin ARB was shown to form aggregates in dilute
   aqueous solutions. The introduction of NPs reduced the size of the
   virgin ARB aggregates. The aggregate forms as viewed by the scanning
   electron microscopy support the light scattering results.

   generated in a reflection from an amorphous silicon composite layer
   with inclusions of crystalline silicon (nanocrystallites) measured at
   room temperature: a decrease in the mean size of the nanocrystallites
   from 100 to 30 nm is accompanied by a shift of the spectral peak near
   3.3 eV by 0.12 eV towards the short wavelengths and an increase in the
   peak width by a factor of 1.5. As a possible mechanism of this

AB The myocardial infarction biomarker myoglobin was quantified at the

   nanosensors with immobilized anti-myoglobin. Method for cardiac
   myoglobin detection is based on direct electron transfer between
   Fe(III)-heme and electrode surface modified with gold
   nanoparticles/didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB/Au) and
   antibodies. The procedure of myoglobin detection was optimized (pH,
   incubation times and characteristics of electrodes) to express
   determination of the marker in serum or plasma. Plasma of healthy
   donors and patients with acute myocardial infarction (AN) was analyzed
   using electrochemical immunosensors and RAMP (R) immunoassay. Square
   wave voltammetry cathodic peak of cardiac myoglobin reduction was found
   to be proportional to myoglobin quantity in plasma as determined by
   RAMP (R).
   The method proposed does not require signal enhancement or
   amplification; nordoes it require labeled secondary antibodies.
   Immunosensor has a detection limit of 10 ng/ml (0.56 nM) and a broad
   range of working concentrations (10-1780 ng/ml; 0.56-100 nM). The whole
   procedure takes 30 min and can be used for express diagnosis of acute
   myocardial infarction. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB CdSe nanocrystals are intercalated into ordered hexagonal arrays of

   channels and their size was estimated to be consistent with the pore
   size. Transmission electron microscopy suggests that CdSe nanocrystals
   have a spherical morphology and are stabilized from aggregation after
   intercalation. The shift of the longitudinal optical bands in the Raman
   spectra is caused by a combination of phonon confinement and strain
   effects from the compressed lattice of the intercalated CdSe
   nanocrystals and the experimental results agree well to the theoretical
   consideration.

AB Films of aliphatic polyurethane-silica composites containing up to 27.3
   mol % of SiO2 nanoparticles have been prepared by the parallel
   synthesis using the sol-gel technology. It has been revealed that the
   variations in the mechanical properties of these materials with
   increasing concentration of nanoparticles exhibit a nontrivial
   behavior: the ultimate strain gradually increases, whereas the elastic
   modulus and the yield stress decrease. A correlation of the changes
   observed in the mechanical characteristics with an increase in the free
   volume of the material with increasing silica concentration has been
   established. Atomic-force microscopy has confirmed the existence of a
   developed system of nanopores with characteristic sizes from 15 to 100

   catalysts for hydrogenation was demonstrated, and the conditions for
   the synthesis of nanoparticles that are highly efficient in
   hydrogenation catalysis were optimized. The modifying effect of
   elemental phosphorus depends on the P/Pd ratio; it is associated with
   changes in the catalyst dispersity and the nature of the formed
   nanoparticles containing various palladium phosphides (PdP2, Pd5P(2),
   and Pd6P) and Pd(0) clusters. The main stages of the formation of
   palladium catalysts for hydrogenation were determined, and a model of
   an active catalyst, in which the Pd6P phosphide is the core of a
   nanoparticle and Pd(0) clusters form a shell, was proposed.

   scattering (SERS) is proposed. The,Substrate is a layer of Ag
   nanoparticles Oil a solid Surface, where the nanoparticles are
   synthesized by photo or thermodecomposition of Langmuir-Blodgett layers
   of the silver salt of a fatty acid. The number of Ag nanoparticles
   depends oil the number and composition of the monolayers. The optical
   properties and morphology of the substrate Were studied by
   ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy, scanning electron
   microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. It Was found that the
   localized Surface plasmon resonance has a maximum extinction in the
   range of 470-480 nm. The SERS ability was tested by use of a

AB CdSe nanocrystals are intercalated into ordered hexagonal arrays of
   mesoporous silica. The nanocrystals are clearly confined in the
   channels and their size was estimated to be consistent with the pore
   size. Transmission electron microscopy suggests that CdSe nanocrystals
   have a spherical morphology and are stabilized from aggregation after
   intercalation. The shift of the longitudinal optical bands in the Raman
   spectra is caused by a combination of phonon confinement and strain
   effects from the compressed lattice of the intercalated CdSe
   nanocrystals and the experimental results agree well to the theoretical
   consideration. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

ID THIN-FILMS; MEMORY; BEHAVIOR
AB The S- and N-shaped current-voltage characteristics have been studied
   for composite films of the conjugated polymer polyfluorene and ZnO
   nanoparticles deposited onto Al and In2O3/SnO2 electrodes with and
   without an intermediate sublayer of the conducting polymer PEDT/PSS.
   The differences in the current- voltage characteristics of the systems
   (the N- and S-types, respectively) are interpreted using the
   electro-thermal switching model, which takes into account the
   structural and electric properties of PEDT/PSS. The switching provides
   both alignment of polymer molecules and tunneling of charge carriers,
   which leads to an increase in conductivity. The current flow in this
   structure causes an increase in temperature of conducting channels;
   when the temperature reaches certain levels, the conductivity of the
   channels decreases because the alignment of polymer molecules is upset,
   which creates an N-shaped form of the current-voltage characteristics.

AB By studying chitosan interactions with poly(styrene sulfonate) anions,
   a procedure that yields chitosan-based non-stoichiometric
   polyelectrolyte complexes soluble in neutral media has been developed.
   The elaborated strategy of the complex formation depended on the
   peculiar order of mixing the polyelectrolyte solutions, which served as
   a remedy for kinetic hindrances. The kinetic restrictions inevitably
   occurred on direct mixing of the components in slightly acidic and
   neutral media, due to the significant contribution of hydrogen bonds in
   stabilization of the intermediate insoluble products. The approach
   developed opens up a new avenue of attack on the problem of preparing
   water soluble biocompatible and biodegradable chitosan complexes that
   are suitable for use at physiological pH and ionic strength.

   of the external light source corresponds to one of the resonant modes
   of the waveguide ring segment, the guided polariton may be treated as
   two optical beams running along the ring segment in the opposite
   directions and interfering with each other. The multisphere Mie
   scattering formalism is used. The dipole approximation is shown to
   grasp the essence of physics. Our simple interpretation of the results
   is obtained in terms of scalar waves. The applications of the

ID SINGLE-DOMAIN PARTICLES; FERROMAGNETIC-RESONANCE; TAPES; SHAPE
AB Magnetostatic fields are studied in the model of a planar assembly of
   magnetic particles forming a periodic lattice infinite in the xy plane
   and finite along the z axis. Two types of lattices are considered:
   simple cubic and body-centered cubic. Exact analytical expressions of
   the magnetostatic fields for the magnetization perpendicular and
   parallel to the xy plane, H-perpendicular to(x, y, z) and H-parallel to
   (x, y, z), are obtained in the form of Fourier series both inside the
   particles, and in the surrounding matrix. Exact formulas for mean
   magnetostatic fields inside the particles, (H) over bar (perpendicular
   to) and (H) over bar (parallel to), are obtained by averaging over the
   particle volume. A numerical analysis of these formulas shows linear
   dependences of (H) over bar (perpendicular to) and (H) over bar
   (parallel to) on the volume filling factor c. A comparison of these
   exact solutions with the results of earlier works where such
   dependences were obtained using different approximate approaches,
   confirms the correctness of some of them. The correctness of methods
   allowing the estimation of the filling factor c from both magnetic
   resonance and magnetometric data is also confirmed.

ID 1ST-ORDER BULK TRANSITIONS; GLASS; ENERGY
AB We have investigated the magnetic ordering and the phase transition in
   MnO nanoparticles confined in a porous glass using polarized neutron
   scattering. These MnO nanoparticles are best described as extended
   wormlike structures with a mean diameter of 70 angstrom. We observe an
   apparent continuous magnetic phase transition in MnO nanoparticles, in
   contrast to the well-known discontinuous phase transition in bulk MnO.
   By polarization analysis, separating the magnetic scattering, it is
   found that within the individual MnO nanoparticles about 60% of atoms
   remain disordered in the low-temperature limit, presumably due to
   interactions between nanoparticles and glass walls. The continuous
   character of the phase transition and the unusual temperature
   dependence suggests a surface-induced disorder phenomenon.

AB Polyelectrolyte capsules with Rhodamine 6G molecules included into the
   shell are obtained in this work. The inclusion of dye molecules into
   the shell can provide the destruction of capsules by
   photosensitization. Measurements of the dye fluorescence intensity in
   the shell show that the energy of photoexcited molecules is effectively
   dissipated by the surrounding organic matrix. The capsule suspension is
   laser irradiated in the absorption band of Rhodamine 6G molecules.
   Measurements of the size distribution of capsules before and after
   laser irradiation reveal that the capsules are destroyed by laser
   illumination.

AB A new view of the opioid peptides is presented. The potential of small
   peptides derived from precursor food proteins, to bind to partly
   unfolded stressed proteins to prevent their irreversible aggregation
   and inactivation has been demonstrated in various in vitro test
   systems: dithiothreitol-induced aggregation of alpha-lactalbumin (LA),
   heat-induced aggregation of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), and
   aggregation and inactivation of bovine erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase
   (CA) in the process of its refolding after removal of stress
   conditions. Using dynamic light scattering (DLS), turbidimetry,
   fluorescence, and circular dichroism measurements protective effects of
   the synthetic opioid peptides: exorphin C from wheat gluten
   (Tyr-Pro-Ile-Ser-Leu), rubiscolin-5 from spinach
   ribulose-bisphosphate-carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco)
   (Tyr-Pro-Leu-Asp-Leu), and hemorphin-6 from bovine hemoglobin
   (Tyr-Pro-Trp-Thr-Gln-Arg) have been revealed. We have demonstrated the
   concentration-dependent suppression of light scattering intensity of
   aggregates of LA and ADH in the presence of the peptides, the
   population of nanoparticles with higher hydrodynamic radii being
   shifted to the lower ones, accompanied by an increase in the lag period
   of aggregation. The presence of the peptides in the refolding solution
   was shown to assist reactivation of CA and enhance the yield of the CA
   soluble protein. The results suggest that bioactive food protein
   fragments may be regarded as exogenous supplements to the endogenous
   defense mechanisms of the human organism under stress conditions. (C)

AB Positron annihilation spectroscopy was employed for defect studies of
   "Ti"-based nanocomposites prepared by high-energy ball milling and
   consisting of Ti nanoparticles separated by hexagonal boron nitride
   (h-BN) or boron (B) additive. The size distribution of nanoscopic holes
   in nanocomposites was determined directly from measurement of
   ortho-positronium (Ps) lifetimes. Chemical environment of defects was
   characterized using coincidence Doppler broadening. It was found that
   size of nanoscopic holes is reduced with increasing milling time in
   H-2/He atmosphere and also probability of Ps formation in holes
   decreases. At the same time the Ti content in the vicinity of holes
   increases. This can be explained by (i) increased intermixing of Ti
   particles with h-BN or B additive and by (ii) filling the nanoscopic
   holes with absorbed hydrogen. Analysis of obtained results showed that
   both these processes take place during milling of nanocomposites. In
   addition, it was found that the effect of filling the nanoscopic pores
   with hydrogen is enhanced in TiH2 milled with h-BN or B in He
   atmosphere. Comparison of nanocomposites with h-BN and B additive
   showed that sufficiently long milling time leads to a similar size
   distribution of nanoscopic holes in Ti/h-BN and Ti/B, despite the fact
   that it differs substantially in the initial powders. However, density
   of nanoscopic holes in Ti/B is significantly lower than in Ti/h-BN
   nanocomposites.

   technique. Platinum nanoparticles were formed on the surface of carbon
   black (commercial E-TEK type catalyst), p-type silicon single-crystals
   wafers with different resistivities, and mesoporous silicon. It is
   established that the activity of surface Pt atoms is higher for
   platinum nanoparticles supported on silicon than on carbon black. An
   increase in the resistivity of silicon favors growth in the catalytic
   activity of platinum. The most pronounced carrier effect is produced by

AB We study the noise spectra and high-frequency permeability of
   inhomogeneous magnetic materials consisting of single-domain magnetic
   nanoparticles embedded into an insulating matrix. Possible mechanisms
   of 1/f voltage noise in phase-separated manganites is analyzed. The
   material is modelled by a system of small ferromagnetic metallic
   droplets (magnetic polarons or ferrons) in insulating antiferromagnetic
   or paramagnetic matrix. The electron transport is related to tunnelling
   of charge carriers between droplets. One of the sources of the 1/f
   noise in such a system stems from fluctuations of the number of
   droplets with extra electron. In the case of strong magnetic
   anisotropy, the 1/f noise can arise also due to the fluctuations of the
   magnetic moments of ferrons. The high frequency magnetic permeability
   of nanocomposite film with magnetic particles in insulating
   non-magnetic matrix is studied in detail. The case of strong magnetic
   dipole interaction and strong magnetic anisotropy of ferromagnetic
   granules is considered. The composite is modelled by a cubic regular
   array of ferromagnetic particles. The high-frequency permeability
   tensor components are found as a functions of frequency, temperature,
   ferromagnetic phase content, and magnetic anisotropy. The results
   demonstrate that magnetic dipole interaction leads to a shift of the
   resonance frequencies towards higher values, and nanocomposite film
   could have rather high value of magnetic permeability in the microwave
   range.

AB Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) are new drug systems composed of
   physiological lipid materials. The possibility of including different
   types of lipids into the NLC structure revealed the wide prospects for
   using biologically active natural oils for the development of the
   cutaneous preparations. In this study the formulation parameters of NLC
   on the basis of Siberian pine seed oil were evaluated including
   concentration of lipids, types of surfactants and storage conditions (4
   degrees C, 20 degrees C, 40 degrees C). Size distribution and storage
   stability of formulations produced by hot high pressure homogenisation
   were investigated by laser diffractometry and photon correlation
   spectroscopy. The NLC were characterised by their melting behaviour
   using differential scanning calorimetry. The obtained data indicated
   the high physical stability of the developed NLC formulations.

AB A doublet is revealed in the light extinction spectrum of a thin silver
   island film and the explanation of its nature is proposed. Based on the
   electron microscopy data, it is found that the doublet cannot be formed
   only by intrinsic resonances of individual islands. Because of
   interisland interactions, light can excite collective fields localized
   near the film. Resonant frequencies of these localized modes depend on
   the size, concentration, and arrangement of individual islands, whose
   plasma oscillation frequencies differ only slightly from one another.

AB A universal probe method for measuring the temperature of large

   experimentally implemented. The temperature of large van der Waals
   clusters (nanoparticles) (CO2) (N) (where N a (c) 3/4 10(2) is the
   number of monomers in a cluster) in the cluster beam is measured using
   this method with SF6 molecules as miniature probe thermometers. The SF6
   molecules are captured by the (CO2) (N) clusters in intersecting
   cluster and molecular beams and sublimate from the surface of the
   clusters, carrying information on the velocity and temperature
   (internal energy) of the clusters. The velocity (kinetic energy) of SF6
   molecules sublimating from the surface of the clusters has been
   measured by the time-of-flight method and the temperature of the
   clusters has been determined as T (cl) = (105 +/- 15) K.

   investigation of interaction of Ag, Cu, Fe, and Pt nanostructures water
   dispersions (NWD), which were produced by means the treatment of water
   by pulsed electric discharges (PED), with serum of human blood (HBS),
   are presented. The goal of the investigation was to determine
   connection between the properties of the nanostructures and
   peculiarities of their interactions with the human blood serum (HBS) as
   highly concentrated solutions of macromolecules. It was found that
   albuminous and lipoprotein structures of HBS are agglutinated on
   surface of the nanoparticles, forming upper molecule complexes. Thus,
   the higher the concentration of nanoparticles in joint dispersion is,
   the larger complexes are formed. At early stages of the process rather
   small complexes of albuminous and immunoglobulins are formed, then
   lipoproteins are agglutinated, and finally, large complexes of
   hydrodynamic radius (R-h) more than 2 mu m are formed.

AB This paper considers the results of measuring the damping factor for an
   oscillatory system in which a magnetic liquid which fills a U-shaped
   glass tube serves as an inertial-viscous component. The role of
   elasticity is played by the air cavity formed inside one of the tube
   elbows under a piezoelectric plate, attached to the tube end face and
   intended for indication of oscillations. A technique for measuring the
   oscillation damping factor and estimating, on this basis, the shear
   viscosity of test magnetic liquid samples in relation to the magnetic
   field strength has been developed. The results of measuring the
   viscosity as a function of magnetic field are discussed for two samples
   one of which was subject to preliminary centrifugation. The use of the
   rotational viscosity model allows one to explain the results obtained
   and to gain information on the geometry of the dispersed nanoparticles.

AB Silver-polyacrylonitrile (Ag-PAN) nanocomposites were in situ
   synthesized by simultaneous polymerization of acrylonitrile and
   reduction of silver ions, starting from mixtures of silver nitrate
   (AgNO3), acrylonitrile (AN), and UV photoinitiator (IN). The films
   obtained proved to be transparent and were characterized by a
   homogeneous dispersion of Ag nanoparticles within the PAN matrix
   without any macroscopic agglomeration. The particle size and number
   density were found to depend on both precursor salt and UV
   photoinitiator weight percentages. Optical and electrical properties
   were investigated as a function of both AgNO3 and IN amounts, too. We
   found that it is possible to finely tailor the metal nanoparticle size
   and number density and, consequently, the film optical and electrical
   response by adjusting the amounts of precursor salt and UV
   photoinitiator in the initial mixtures.

AB Poly(4-vinylpyridine) derivatives alkylated with dimethylsulfate,
   octylbromide and dodecylbromide were synthesized. Bromide anions in the
   polymer salts were substituted with octylsulfate, dodecylsulfate or
   bis(2-ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate (AOT) anions using ion-exchange
   reactions. The small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) studies of the
   structure of the comb-like polysalts demonstrated their highly-ordered
   structure. Loading the comb-like polycation with the surfactant anions
   leads to additional ordering of the polysalts structure. in the case of
   large AOT anions the transition from lamella to hexagonal structure is
   observed. Polyelectrolyte - surfactant complexes (PEC) of
   poly(4-vinyl-1-methylpyridinium) cation with octylsulfate and
   dodecylsulfate counter ions demonstrate a higher degree of order than
   the comb-like polymers having a similar chemical structure. The SAXS
   studies were complemented by dynamic light scattering study of the
   solutions of the polymers in chloroform. In the solution the comb-like
   polymers and their complexes with linear surfactants have coil
   conformations with the size of the coils close to that of the original
   poly-4-vinylpyridine. The conformations of PECs with octylsulfate and
   dodecylsulfate counter ions are more unfolded than those of the
   corresponding comb-like polymers. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB A common microbial strategy for detoxifying metals involves redox
   transformation which often results in metal precipitation and/or
   immobilization. In the present study, the influence of ionic nickel
   [Ni(II)] on growth of the purple sulfur bacterium Thiocapsa
   roseopersicina was investigated. The results suggest that Ni(II) in the
   bulk medium at micromolar concentrations results in growth inhibition,
   specifically an increase in the lag phase of growth, a decrease in the
   specific growth rate, and a decrease in total protein concentration
   when compared to growth controls containing no added Ni(II). The
   inhibitory effects of Ni(II) on the growth of T roseopersicina could be
   partially overcome by the addition of hydrogen (H-2) gas. However, the
   inhibitory effects of Ni(II) on the growth of T. roseopersicina were
   not alleviated by H-2 in a strain containing deletions in all
   hydrogenase-en coding genes, Transmission electron micrographs of
   wild-type T roseopersicina grown in the presence of Ni(II) and H-2
   revealed a significantly greater number of dense nanoparticulates
   associated with the cells when compared to wild-type cells grown in the
   absence of H-2 and hydrogenase mutant strains grown in the presence of
   H-2. X-ray diffraction and vibrating sample magnetometry of the dense
   nanoparticles indicated the presence of zerovalent Ni, suggesting
   Ni(II) reduction. Purified T roseopersicina hyn-encoded hydrogenase
   catalyzed the formation of zerovalent Ni particles in vitro, suggesting
   a role for this hydrogenase in Ni(II) reduction in vivo. Collectively,
   these results suggest a link among H-2 metabolism, Ni(II) tolerance,
   and Ni(II) reduction in T roseopersicina.

AB Stem cell based tissue engineering therapies involve the administration
   of ex vivo manipulated stem cell populations with the purpose of
   repairing and regenerating damaged or diseased tissue. Currently
   available methods of monitoring transplanted cells are quite limited.
   To monitor the outcomes of stem cell therapy longitudinally requires
   the development of non-destructive strategies that are capable of
   identifying the location, magnitude. and duration of cellular survival
   and fate. The recent development of imaging techniques offers great
   potential to address these critical issues by non-invasively tracking
   the fate of the transplanted cells. This review offers a focused
   presentation of some examples of the use of imaging techniques
   connected to the nanotechnological world in research areas related to
   stem cells. In particular investigations will be considered concerning
   tissue-engineered bone, treatment of intervertebral disc degeneration,
   treatment by human stem cells Of muscular dystrophy of Duchenne in
   small animal models and the repair of spinal cord injuries. (c) 2009

   were analyzed with special attention paid to the direct optical
   bandgap. Atmospheric radio-frequency barrier torch discharge and pulsed
   hollow cathode sputtering techniques for the film fabrication were
   used. For the crystalline films, similar values of the direct optical
   bandgap were found independent of the growth method used. The analysis
   of the amorphous films and powders revealed a pronounced Urbach-like
   exponential absorption tail approaching the bandedge. For the powders,
   the bandgap energies were larger than those for the crystalline and
   amorphous films. A decrease in the powder particle size in the powders
   leads to an increased direct optical bandgap.

ID MGB2; SUPERCONDUCTIVITY
AB We have studied the phase composition of materials obtained by
   mechanochemical processing and subsequent heat treatment of mixtures of
   magnesium and boron powders in the atomic ratio 1: 2. Differential
   dissolution, differential scanning calorimetry, and X-ray diffraction
   data indicate that, during mechanical processing, some of the magnesium
   reacts with boron to form amorphous magnesium diboride. During
   annealing of the activated powder mixture, X-ray amorphous magnesium
   diboride forms at 340A degrees C and crystallizes at 480A degrees C. As
   shown by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, the
   unreacted crystalline magnesium is covered with an amorphous layer
   consisting of magnesium diboride and boron. The amorphous material
   obtained by milling contains nuclei of MgB2 crystallites 3-5 nm in
   size. During subsequent heating of the activated mixture, magnesium and
   boron react further to form amorphous magnesium diboride and the
   amorphous phase crystallizes. Heating of mechanically activated
   mixtures to just below the crystallization temperature allow MgB2
   nanoparticles to be produced. The formation of nanocrystalline
   magnesium diboride nuclei along with the amorphous phase during
   mechanochemical processing facilitates mechanochemical synthesis
   compared to thermal synthesis.

AB Mathematical expressions are derived for three photon distribution
   functions w (N) (M) (T), w (N) (Z) (T), and w (N) (O) (T) corresponding
   to three different methods for counting fluorescence photons from a
   single nanoparticle excited by continuous laser radiation. Each of the
   three functions is expressed in terms of Poisson functions, which makes
   it possible to pass in the w (N) (M) (T), w (N) (Z) (T), and w (N) (O)
   functions from N multiple integrals to single or double integrals. This
   not only eases the numerical calculation of the photon distribution,
   but it also makes it possible to find that, for each exponential
   process in the dynamics of a nanoparticle, there is a Poisson function
   in the photon distribution function. All three photon counting methods
   yield the same photon distribution for continuous fluorescence and
   different photon distributions for blinking fluorescence.

AB This paper reports on a study of the stability of silicon clusters of
   intermediate size at a high temperature. The temperature dependence of
   the physicochemical properties of 60- and 73-atom silicon nanoparticles
   are investigated using the molecular dynamics method. The 73-atom
   particles have a crystal structure, a random atomic packing, and a
   packing formed by inserting a 13-atom icosahedron into a 60-atom
   fullerene. They are surrounded by a 'coat' from 60 atoms of hydrogen.
   The nanoassembled particle at the presence of a hydrogen 'coat' has the
   most stable number (close to four) of Si-Si bonds per atom. The
   structure and kinetic properties of a hollow single-layer
   fullerene-structured Si60 cluster are considered in the temperature
   range 10 K T 1760 K. Five series of calculations are conducted, with a
   simulation of several media inside and outside the Si60 cluster,
   specifically, the vacuum and interior spaces filled with 30 and 60
   hydrogen atoms with and without the exterior hydrogen environment of 60
   atoms. Fullerene surrounded by a hydrogen 'coat' and containing 60
   hydrogen atoms in the interior space has a higher stability. Such
   clusters have smaller self-diffusion coefficients at high temperatures.
   The fullerene stabilized with hydrogen is stable to the formation of
   linear atomic chains up to the temperatures 270-280 K.

   sizes (microcrystalline cubic shape, nanorod shape and nanocrystalline
   cubical shaped) have been prepared by the chemical coprecipitation
   method. Thermoluminescence (TL) and other dosimetric characteristics of
   the phosphor are studied and presented here. The formation of the
   materials was confirmed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD). Its shapes and
   sizes were also observed using scanning electron microscope (SEM). The
   TL glow curve of the microcrystalline powder shows a prominent single
   peak at 408 K along with another peak of lesser intensity at around 638
   K. On the contrary, the nanocrystalline rod shaped particles show a
   peak of low intensity at 401 K and a prominent peak around 700 K while
   the nanocrystalline particles in cubical shapes again show two peaks,
   one at around 407 K and the other at around 617 K, of which the lower
   temperature (407 K) peak is more prominent. The glow curve structure
   changes at very high doses (100 kRad) and some new peaks appear at
   around 525 and 637 K also the first peak appearing at around 401 K
   becomes prominent. The observed changes in TL due to the change in the
   shape and sizes of the nanophosphor have been reported. The PL has also
   been studied and various excitation and emission peaks observed due to
   the presence of various impurities are explained. The observed results
   have been explained in the light of asymmetrical crystal field effects
   due to asymmetrical shapes of the nanocrystalline phosphor. The
   comparison of these properties with the microcrystalline material
   prepared by the same co-precipitation method is also done. (C) 2009

AB To identify the explosive used in a terrorist attack, or to obtain an
   early sign of environmental pollution it is important to use simple and
   rapid assays able to detect analytes at low levels, possibly on-site.
   This is particularly true for TNT (2,4,6-trinitrotoluene), one of the
   most employed explosives in the 20th century and at the same time,
   because of its toxicity, a well known pollutant. In this work we
   describe the development of an indirect competitive ELISA with
   chemiluminescent detection (CL-ELISA) and of a lateral-flow immunoassay
   (LFIA) based on colloidal gold nanoparticle labels. A commercially
   available monoclonal antibody was used and 13 specially synthesized
   conjugates were tested. We optimized the assay by determining the
   optimal concentration of monoclonal antibody and conjugates and the
   influence of various non-specific factors such as: tolerance to organic
   solvents at different concentrations, the washing and competitive step
   time, and the cross-reactivity with related compounds. The sensitivity
   and reproducibility of the CL-ELISA were good (LOD and IC50 values in
   the ng mL(-1) range, and CV value about 7%). It has been applied to
   real samples of various materials involved in a controlled explosion of
   an "improvised explosive device". Three extraction procedures were
   tested on these samples, all employing methanol as the solvent. The
   lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA), developed by using the same
   immunoreagents, reached a detection limit of 1 mu g mL(-1) when tested
   on the same samples analysed by CL-ELISA.

AB Basic thermodynamic characteristics (density distribution profile near
   the surface of a nanoparticle, adsorption, and interfacial surface
   tension) of the structureless nanoparticle-vapor/liquid equilibrium
   system are calculated using a unified approach. A joint solution of the
   basic equation in the Van der Waals theory of an inhomogeneous medium
   for the density distribution profile in the spherical system of
   coordinates and the Gibbs equation for the interfacial tension and
   absorption is obtained. The features of nucleation of nanoparticles are
   considered. The results generalize some familiar formulas and provide a

AB The impurity content and microhomogeneity of Ge25Sb10S65 glass samples,
   prepared by direct synthesis from elements, were investigated. It was
   shown that the increase in temperature of synthesis of the
   glass-forming melt resulted in the increase of the content of
   impurities of H, Na, Al, Si. K, Ca and transition metals in the
   prepared glasses. The glasses from the melt, subjected to
   chemical-distillation purification, were characterized by the low
   content of gas-forming impurities and the increased content of Al, Si
   and Cl. The glasses contained heterophase impurity inclusions mainly
   consisting Of SiO2, and their concentration and size depended on the
   conditions of glass preparation. The impurity content in the purest
   glasses was as follows: oxygen - <0.5 ppm wt. carbon - <5 ppm wt,
   hydrogen - 0.1 ppm wt, Si - <1 ppm wt, transition metals - <0.25 ppm
   wt, heterophase impurity inclusions with sizes larger than 80 nm -
   <10(2) cm(3). It was shown that heterophase impurity inclusions behaved
   as the centers of glass crystallization. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Optical second-harmonic (SH) generation in Au/Co/Au sandwich-like
   nanodisks is studied, using several experimental techniques, at SH
   frequency being close to that of the plasmon resonance in the system.
   The dependences of the relative amplitude and phase of the
   magnetization-induced SH component on the angle of incidence are found
   to significantly differ from those measured for a continuous Au/Co/Au
   trilayer film. A phenomenological description of the observed effects
   is proposed, with special emphasis on resonant excitation of the local
   plasmon modes by the nonlinear sources induced in the nanodisks.

AB A procedure is proposed for determining the relative number

   particle-number size distributions. The effects of the synthesis
   temperature and the salt (AgNO3)-to-reducing agent (tannin)
   concentration ratio on the formation of silver nanoparticles and the
   stability of systems are studied. It is established that variations in
   the temperature within a wide range do not influence the formation of
   silver nanoparticles in the examined systems and the stability of the
   latter. The reduction level of silver ions substantially depends on the
   amount of AgNO3 present in a system and the precursor-toreducing agent

AB Peculiarities of the nucleation and growth of gold nanoparticles on
   adsorption layers and in ultrathin films of poly(2-vinylpyridine) (PVP)
   in the chemical reduction of sorbed Au(III) ions and the consequent
   thermal treatment of systems are studied by X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy and optical spectroscopy. It is shown that nitrogens of
   PVP pyridine groups coordinate gold atoms. It is revealed that, even at
   relatively short contact between PVP film saturated with chloroauric
   acid and the solution of strong reductant NaBH4, Au(III) ions are
   reduced to metal. As a result, quasi-metal gold particles are formed.
   At the same time, when exposing a PVP-Au system to the solution of weak
   reductant NH2OH, the process of reduction proceeds in several stages.
   First, Au(III) ions are reduced to Au(I) followed by the reduction to
   Au(0) as a result of disproportionation reaction. It is demonstrated
   for the first time that, upon using NH2OH, the rate of reduction, as
   well as the structure of prepared PVP-Au nanocomposite films depends to
   substantial extent on solution pH. Prolonged annealing of ultrathin
   nanocomposites at 150 A degrees C, i.e., above the glass transition
   temperature of polymer matrix, leads to an increase in the sizes of
   metal particles and the formation of systems characterized by intense
   absorption within the 500-600-nm range due to the localized plasmon
   resonance of gold nanoparticles.

AB The article presents a noninvasive approach to the study of erythrocyte
   properties by means of a comparative analysis of signals obtained by
   surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and resonance Raman
   spectroscopy (RS). We report step-by-step the procedure for preparing
   experimental samples containing erythrocytes in their normal
   physiological environment in a mixture of colloid solution with silver
   nanoparticles and the procedure for the optimization of SERS conditions
   to achieve high signal enhancement without affecting the properties of
   living erythrocytes. By means of three independent techniques, we
   demonstrate that under the proposed conditions a colloid solution of
   silver nanoparticles does not affect the properties of erythrocytes.
   For the first time to our knowledge, we describe how to use the SERS-RS
   approach to study two populations of hemoglobin molecules inside an
   intact living erythrocyte: submembrane and cytosolic hemoglobin (Hb(sm)
   and Hb(c)). We show that the conformation of Hbsm differs from the
   conformation of Hbc. This finding has an important application, as the
   comparative study of Hbsm and Hbc could be successfully used in
   biomedical research and diagnostic tests.

   potential for silver nanoparticles prepared in aqueous solution of

   dissipation. The changes in the size distribution for nanoparticles and
   their zeta potential were monitored over time. The size of particles
   was found to degrease linearly with increasing pH; a similar effect was
   created by the maturation of colloidal solution. The zeta potential of
   the maturation process tended to take an identical value for all
   hydrosol samples studied. A procedure is proposed for the numerical
   calculation of the relative concentration of nanoparticles that is
   applicable for the investigation of samples with various types of
   distribution for particle sizes. The degree of reduction for silver
   ions was found to depend significantly on the quantity of AgNO3
   presented and the ration between the precursor and the reducing agent.

AB In this work, we explored the effects of the electrode material
   constituents and structure on the composition, tribological properties,
   and roughness of electrospark deposited coatings. Nanostructured (WC
   grain size below 0.1 mu m) and microstructured (WC grain size 1-2 mu m)
   electrodes based on 92% WC-8% Co composition were used to produce
   coatings on titanium alloy substrates. Fine-pored graphite (FPG) and
   carbon-carbon fiber composite (CCFC) electrodes were additionally used
   for surface smoothing as a finishing operation. The use of the
   nanostructured electrodes resulted in the formation of fine-grained,
   hard, and wear-resistant coatings. Surface finishing treatment with
   graphite-containing electrodes was found to decrease friction
   coefficients and improve the wear resistance of coatings deposited with
   both nano- and microstructured electrodes. This finishing operation
   provided lower surface roughness, change in the phase composition of
   the coatings, and formation of surface graphite for solid lubrication.

AB Single magnetic nanodots, exchange coupled to an antiferromagnetic (AF)
   matrix, can produce large exchange bias, while superparamagnetic
   behavior of the nanodots is suppressed. The exchange bias originates
   from the formation of a (quasi)spherical domain wall inside the AF
   matrix when the particle moment rotates under the influence of an
   external magnetic field. Micromagnetic calculations show that for
   isolated nanodots the energy of this domain wall increases nearly
   quadratically with the deflection angle of the nanodot moment. By
   introducing the corresponding quadratic energy term in a modified
   Stoner-Wohlfarth model, a two-parameter family of hysteresis loops is
   obtained, depending on scaled anisotropy energy and field direction.
   The loops are represented in a phase diagram with three main regions,
   containing (1) reversible loops, (2) irreversible loops with a
   metastable 180 degrees AF domain wall, and (3) loops with metastable AF
   domain walls with 360 degrees or higher rotation angles. According to
   this model, isolated nanodots display reversible negatively biased
   loops for all field directions, if their anisotropy energy is small in
   comparison to the AF domain-wall energy. For higher anisotropy,
   irreversible, mostly negatively biased, loops result from switching
   between the ground state and an higher-energy inverse state with a 180
   degrees AF domain wall. At even higher anisotropy energy, the loops can
   show positive exchange bias after an initial "training branch."
   Switching after "training" takes place between states having a 180
   degrees and a 360 degrees AF domain wall, respectively. While for thin
   films, the bias field increases in inverse proportion to thickness, for
   nanodots it increases in inverse proportion to the square of particle
   diameter. Therefore, nanodots can show significantly larger exchange
   bias than thin films of similar dimension. Hysteresis loops, obtained
   from averaging over directions and sizes using the modified
   Stoner-Wohlfarth model, were compared to measurements from a natural
   sample with nanometer-scale ilmenite-exsolution lamellae in a hematite
   matrix. The shapes of the hysteresis difference, the difference between
   upper and lower branches, are similar for model and experiment, whereby
   increasing temperature in the measurement corresponds qualitatively to
   decreasing the relative anisotropy energy in the model.

AB Nano-sized WS2 based powders were synthesized by chemical vapor

   precursor and vaporized sulphur. Prior to WS2 nanopowders synthesis,
   pure tungsten nanopowders were produced by chemical vapor condensation
   to define the optimum synthesis parameters, which were then
   successfully applied to synthesize tungsten disulphide. The influence
   of experimental parameters on phase and chemical composition as well as
   mean size of the particles in order to produce pure tungsten and WS2
   nanopowders was studied. Structure, phase composition and particles
   size of WS2 nanoparticles were precisely characterized by means of XRD,

AB Material contained BN nanostructures-single-wall nanotubes, polyhedral

   of boron nitride target in nitrogen atmosphere. Optical absorption
   spectroscopy has revealed two bands corresponding to the defects states
   in BN nanostructures. The quantum-chemical calculations on the models
   of BN sheets have shown that the bands around 5.4 and 4.45 eV could be
   attributed to the vacancies obtained by removing of respectively BN
   pair and BN hexagon from the BN network. Comparison between X-ray
   absorption fine structure near the N K-edge and theoretical spectra
   corresponding to the unoccupied electronic states of nitrogen atoms has
   confirmed a formation of these types of vacancies in the layers of BN
   nanostructures synthesized by the laser vaporization method.

AB The method of stochastic simulations was applied to studying the
   kinetics of nucleation and growth of nanoparticles from solution in the
   presence of a ligand-yielding stabilizer. It was established that, at
   large stabilizer concentrations the process is not described within the
   framework of the law of mass action, being appreciably dependent on
   stochastic fluctuations in the number of free vacancies at the surface
   of the growing particle. This factor is responsible for the limitation
   of particle growth and for the formation of stable particles with a
   loose packing and dendrite-like structure. With decreasing stabilizer
   concentration, the kinetic characteristics of the process approach
   those typical of classical kinetics, whereas the packing density

AB Methods have been proposed and tested for analyzing local magnetic

   encapsulated in carbon nanotubes are characterized by two-modal
   distribution functions of the local magnetic anisotropy energy. The
   particle distribution over the blocking temperature is reconstructed
   from the experimental temperature dependence of the coercive force. The
   allowance made for the inhomogeneity of the local magnetic parameters
   of the Fe3C nanoparticles, which were studied by the proposed methods,
   explains the discrepancy between the magnetic anisotropy energy
   determined by the method of the magnetization approaching saturation
   and the magnetic anisotropy energy estimated from the coercive force of
   single-domain nanoparticles.

   were studied on nanocrystalline SrTiO3/Cr(0.1%) powders with an average
   particle size between 13 and 100 nm prepared by the Pechini type
   polymeric sol-gel method. Only O-h(1) cubic perovskite phase was
   revealed in the powders at room temperature. The optical absorption
   edge and the position of the zero-phonon emission R-line of the
   octahedral Cr3+ centres shifted to higher energies with decreasing
   particle size. The temperature shift of the R-line position appeared
   for all powders nearly the same as the 'dielectric related' one in the
   bulk crystals, evidencing that SrTiO3 retains quantum paraelectric
   behaviour down to a particle size of about 10 nm. However, behaviour of
   the R-line position was unstable at low temperatures in powders with a
   particle size of about 13 and 20 nm. This instability was speculated as
   a manifestation of a possible low temperature ferroelectric phase
   transition in small enough SrTiO3 nanoparticles.

AB The influence of an acetylene fraction in a mixture with argon on the
   parameters of a radio-frequency gas discharge has been investigated
   using the kinetic simulation by the particle-in-cell Monte Carlo
   collision method. Special attention has been focused on analyzing the
   formation of ions and radicals that are precursors for growth of
   nanoparticles in the gas discharge volume. It has been shown that the
   concentrations of electrons, positive ions, and negative ions are
   nonmonotonic functions of the acetylene amount in the mixture. The
   presence of negative ions with a concentration comparable to the
   electron concentration changes the parameters of the radio-frequency
   gas discharge only insignificantly.

   (MSM-41) molecular sieve matrix. The X-ray diffraction data show
   evidence for the formation of CoFe2O4 particles with a coherent

   magnetization curves showed that powders consisting of these
   nanoparticles are magnetically hard materials with a coercive field of
   H (c)(4.2 K) = 9.0 kOe and H (c)(300 K) = 1.8 kOe and a reduced
   remanent magnetization of M (r)/M (s)(4.2 K) = 0.83 and M (r)/M (s)(300
   K) = 0.49. The shape of the low-temperature (4.2 K) magnetization
   curves is adequately described in terms of the Stoner-Wohlfarth model
   for randomly oriented single-domain particles with a cubic magnetic

ID NANODIAMONDS
AB The synthesis of intermetallic compounds belonging to the
   nickel-aluminum system in the presence of detonation nanodiamond (DND)
   particles leads to a significant change in the structure of
   consolidated nanocrystals. The broadening of (111), (220), and (311)
   X-ray diffraction reflections usually decreases by an order of
   magnitude, which indicates that the size of nanocrystals increases in
   approximately the same proportion. This effect significantly depends on
   the state of the surface of diamond nanoparticles. The X-ray data
   suggest that aluminum present in the initial metal-diamond mixture
   actively interacts with oxygen adsorbed on the surface of particles,
   which leads to the formation of Al2O3 oxide. The interaction between
   particles via cleaned interfaces at high temperatures leads to the
   activation of recrystallization processes.

AB The theory and practical applications of very slow (antisymmetric)
   optical plasmons are described. These plasmons can exist on thin metal
   films and filaments and (as standing waves) on metal spheres and
   ellipsoids. The material presented here extends the conventional
   concepts of electromagnetic modes of spaces, probability of spontaneous
   emission, construction of optical images, optical focusing, and the
   photon momentum. The reviewed achievements in this field have been
   obtained in the last years. The problem of the photon momentum in a
   medium has been a subject of irreconcilable disputes for nearly 100
   years, beginning with Minkowski and Abraham's famous papers. Various
   practical applications are considered, including experiments with the
   significant enhancement of atom spontaneous emission into a plasmon
   field mode of a nanoparticle; experiments on focusing optical radiation
   into a spot much smaller than the diffraction-limited one (the
   so-called almost ideal Pendry lens, which produces an image with
   details much smaller than the light wavelength); and, finally, a
   greatly increased (by factors of 10, 100, or more) photon momentum in
   plasmon.

   (PEDOT) films, the composite films (PEDOT-Au) are synthesized. Their
   electrochemical properties are studied by cyclic voltammetric (CVA)
   method. It is shown that in contrast to the original PEDOT film, the
   CVA curves of composite PEDOT-Au films measured in the presence of
   chloride ions reveal additional redox peaks associated with the
   presence of gold particles. The loading of metal gold particles by its
   chemical deposition into the polymer film is quantitatively assessed
   using quartz crystal microbalance method. The film mass is shown to
   depend on the time of gold loading and its original concentration in
   solution. The gold particles are shown to be oxidized by a reaction of
   the first order with respect to chloride ions. Based on the results of
   voltammetric and microbalance methods, the formation of a poorly
   soluble gold oxidation product Au(I)Cl in chloride-containing solutions
   was inferred.

AB Hall effect and flux pinning in YBa2Cu3O6+x (YBCO) thin films doped
   with BaZrO3 (BZO) nanoparticles is investigated. The results show that
   sign reversal of the Hall coefficient from positive hole-like to
   negative electron-like occurs in vortex-liquid regime of undoped and
   BZO-doped YBCO films. With increasing BZO concentration the amplitude
   of the negative Hall effect is suppressed while the temperature
   position of the anomalous Hall effect does not depend significantly on
   doping level. In addition, it is shown that Hall conductivity increases
   non-monotonically with increasing BZO doping. These results support a
   model where BZO at low doping concentration induces point pinning
   centres turning to strong columnar pinning defects in films doped with
   4% BZO. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It has been shown that a composite film activated by spherical
   nanoparticles can ensure ideal optical antireflection when the
   amplitude of the transmitted light wave is equal to the amplitude of
   the external wave at various angles of incidence independently on the
   optical properties of the underlying medium. The amplitude of the
   reflected wave vanishes in a wide range of optical wavelengths. It has
   been shown that the effect of ideal optical antireflection occurs when

AB The formation of iron oxide nanoparticles in planar DNA complexes
   immobilized on substrates has been studied in reactions involving only
   biogenic reagents (ferritin and ascorbic acid) in aqueous solutions
   under normal conditions. Using transmission electron microscopy, we
   revealed ordered quasi-linear arrays of iron oxide nanoparticles 2-4 nm
   in diameter, which probably resulted from nanoparticle binding to
   linear DNA molecules. The electron diffraction patterns of the
   synthesized nanoparticles are characteristic of polycrystalline
   magnetic iron oxide (magnetite of maghemite) nanoparticles and point to
   good crystallinity of the nanoparticles. Our results demonstrate the
   feasibility of the synthesis of ordered arrays of iron oxide
   nanoparticles using DNA complexes and may have direct implications for
   the understanding of biomineralization processes and iron metabolism in
   living systems.

AB Powder precursors of the Al2O3-ZrO2 system were synthesized by the

   diffraction, and method of adsorption-desorption isotherms were used to
   characterize the interrelations between particle size and phase
   transition in the Al2O3-ZrO2 system. It was revealed that azeotropic
   drying under overpressure is quite effective for obtaining
   well-dispersed powder precursors synthesized by the sol-gel method. In
   contrast to bulk materials, tetragonal, cubic, and rnonoclinic phases
   were found to exist in a wider temperature-composition range. It was
   shown that the existing phase symmetry in the well-dispersed powders
   correlates with the crystallite size.

AB Laser-induced luminescence of multilayer structures based on the solids
   of CdSe and CdSe/ZnS nanocrystals, different organic semiconductors and
   on the layers of organic semiconductors with embedded nanocrystals has
   been investigated. Drastic decrease of luminescence quantum yield is
   observed in the films of CdSe nanocrystals on organic semiconductors
   compared to those on optical glasses. ne luminescence of the
   nanocrystals in the matrices of organic semiconductors and in
   multilayer structures is shown to be suppressed. The effects observed
   are explained by the transfer of photogenerated carriers from the
   nanocrystals to the molecules of organic semiconductors. The presence
   of the charge transfer is confirmed by a drastic increase in the
   conductivity (by 2-4 orders of magnitude) and in photovoltaic effect at
   the presence of CdSe and CdSe/ZnS nanocrystals in the structures under
   investigation. The prospects of using the multilayer structures for
   development new materials for solar cells are discussed.

TI Modeling process kinetics in Cu/C nanocomposite synthesis
SO THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB We have studied the kinetics of chemical transformations in
   polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and composite Cu/PAN (C (Cu) = 10% (mass)) at P
   = 10(-5) Pa in the range of temperatures of 20-700A degrees C during
   heating according to the linear law with a velocity of 10A degrees
   C/min with the method of thermogravimetry. From the conducted kinetic
   studies of pyrolysis, it can be inferred that kinetic data of the
   destruction reaction of PAN and a composite of Cu/PAN are described
   with differential dependences on the basis of heterogeneous chemical
   reaction equations. Experimental data prove the heterogeneous reactions
   of the first order. The limiting stages of the process depend on the
   kinetic processes of chemical bonds opening in the polymer and
   composite. For the reaction of composite Cu/PAN in a vacuum, the
   determinant is the decomposition of copper salt and a PAN complex with
   the formation of copper nanoparticles at 470-570 K.

AB The structure and hydrophilic-hydrophobic properties of functionalized
   single-wall carbon nanotubes are studied by the standard porosimetry
   method. It is shown that the functionalized nanotubes have highly
   hydrophilic surface; at that the summary surface area measured "by
   octane" decreased, as a result of the functionalizing, due to the
   blocking of the nanotubes' inner channels by the functional groups
   located at the nanotubes' ends. The nanotubes' capacitive properties
   are studied; their charging-discharging curves appeared being highly
   reversible, unlike those of other carbonaceous materials. Catalytic
   properties of the functionalized nanotubes are studied, with particular
   tendency toward their using as a carrier of platinum catalysts for the
   methanol oxidation and oxygen electroreduction reactions. When minor
   amounts(5-10 mu g cm(-2)) of platinum or platinum-ruthenium alloy are
   deposited onto the nanotubes' hydrophilic surface, uniform layer of the
   catalyst is formed, with specific surface area up to 150-300 m(2)
   g(-1); high current of the methanol oxidation or oxygen
   electroreduction is observed at these catalysts. When the catalyst
   deposit mass increased, its specific surface area decreased, as well as
   the specific current of the reactions occurring thereon. When the
   current is related to the electrochemically active unit surface, the
   catalytic activity is nearly the same both for different catalyst mass
   deposited onto the nanotubes and the same catalyst mass at different
   carbonaceous carriers.

AB The interaction of DNA with nanoparticles of cobalt ferrite powder
   prepared by the mechano-chemical method was studied. It was shown that
   CoFe2O4 nanoparticles efficiently bind DNA in aqueous solutions
   (Tris-HCl), forming a bionanocomposite. The adsorption capacity of
   CoFe2O4 nanoparticles for DNA was evaluated to be 5.25 x 10(-3)
   mol/m(2). The desorption of DNA from the surface of the particles was
   analyzed while changing the pH, the ionic strength, and the chemical
   content of the medium. The DNA-CoFe2O4 nanocomposite was investigated
   by FTIR spectroscopy. The block of the data allowed one to consider the
   mechanism of the interaction between a polynucleotide and CoFe2O4
   nanoparticles and to make the assumption that the binding occurred due
   to the coordination interaction of the phosphate groups and
   heterocyclic bases of DNA (oxygen atoms of thymine and guanine) with
   metal ions on the particle surface. The analysis of the IR spectra
   showed that binding can lead to the partial destabilization of the DNA
   structure, with the B conformation of a polynucleotide being preserved.

ID CRYSTAL-SURFACE; ALCOHOLS; ICE
AB The Monte Carlo method is applied to the study of the formation of
   condensed-phase nuclei from water vapor on electrically charged silver
   iodide nanocrystals. This study is a continuation of the investigations
   carried out earlier in [1] with electrically neutral nucleation
   centers. Nanoparticles with a size of up to 4 nm and flat nanoparticles
   with a size of up to 10 nm are investigated. The free energy, entropy,
   and the work of formation of nuclei with a size of up to 6729 molecules
   are calculated at the atomic level by the bicanonical statistical
   ensemble (BSE) method at a temperature of 260 K. Thermodynamic
   stability of nuclei is investigated depending on the size, shape, and
   charge of nanocrystal nucleation centers, as well as depending on the
   presence of crystal defects and the degree of spatial localization of
   charge on the surface of nanoparticles. The excess charge has a crucial
   effect on the work of formation of a nucleus only in the case of strong
   spatial localization of the latter near a point crystal defect;
   however, this effect is restricted to a relatively small size of the
   nuclei and therefore cannot substantially enhance the ice-forming
   activity of nanoparticles. A nucleus that grows on the surface of a
   nanoparticle evolves through three stages that differ in molecule
   retention mechanism and thermodynamic stability. The charge of a
   nanoparticle has a small effect on these factors. The leading factor
   that determines the ice-forming activity of ion nanocrystals is their
   intrinsic electric field due to the nonuniform distribution of charge
   within a unit cell of the crystal lattice.

AB A method of controlled potential electrodeposition of the cobalt
   nanoparticles with sizes from 30 to 400 nm on the surface of highly
   oriented pyrolytic graphite has been developed. The images of
   nanoparticles were obtained with an atomic force microscope. A computer
   program was applied to obtain the size distribution of electrodeposited
   particles depending on the electrodeposition potential, electrolytic
   concentration, and deposition time. Using voltammetry it has been
   established that the cobalt nanoparticles with the diameter of about 50

DT Article
AB HREM and XPD methods are used to study the microstructure of
   La1-xCaxMnO3 perovskite-like oxides synthesized by pyrolysis of
   polymer-salt compositions. The XPD data show that the samples studied
   are single-phase solid solutions. Morphological transitions are
   observed in series of samples depending on the substitution parameter
   x. At 0 <= x <= 0.4 the samples can be characterized by rhombic
   symmetry ( space group Pnmb); at 0.5 <= x <= 0.8 the symmetry increases
   to the tetragonal space group 14/mmm; at 0.9 <= x <= 1 the symmetry
   lowers to the monoclinic space group P1121. Heating of samples with x =
   0.5 and 0.8 up to 1200 degrees C in air does not lead to noticeable
   changes in the sample structure, which indicates their high thermal
   stability. When the La0.2Ca0.8MnO3 sample is heated to 1100 degrees C
   in vacuum nanocrystalline states with particle disintegration into
   microphases of different structures form because of a partial
   decomposition of the solid solution. As a result, a system of Mn3O4
   nanoparticles appears, which is coherently bound with the perovskite
   phase of a defective structure.

AB Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of Gd3+ ions in

   with crystallite sizes ranging from 600 nm down to 5 nm have been
   measured at X-band and at Q-band near liquid He and room temperatures.
   The EPR line shape is controlled by the low-symmetry surrounding of
   Gd3+ ions in a coordination environment with one oxygen-vacancy and
   seven oxygen nearest-neighbors forming GdO7 polyhedra. These
   coordination polyhedra are characterized by a wide distribution of
   crystal field parameters that primarily controls the EPR linewidth. The
   EPR linewidth of the central (-1/2 <->+1/2) transition is observed to
   decrease systematically with decreasing crystallite size. This
   observation implies that the size of the crystallites in the nanoregime
   may have important influence on the energetics of vacancy distribution
   in crystalline materials. (C) 2009 American Institute of Physics.

AB X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is used to study the electronic
   states of copper oxide covering a thin (2.0 +/- 0.5 nm) layer of
   ultradisperse copper. A reduction in the thickness of the CuO layer is
   found to cause extremal behavior in the XPS spectrum parameters as
   opposed to their monontonic variations for CuO nanoparticles. This
   behavior is explained by the competition of two factors which affect
   the system under study: the dimensions of the substrate material and
   the electrostatic field in it.

DE laser plume; laser ablation; nanoparticles
AB The dynamics of the plume ejected from the surface of solid targets
   (YSZ, Nd:YAG and graphite) by a CO2 laser pulse with a duration of
   similar to 500 mu s (at the 0.03 level), energy of 1.0 - 1.3 J and peak
   power of 6 - 7 kW have been studied using high-speed photography of the

   nanopowders by laser evaporation. About 200 mu s after termination of
   the pulse, shadowgraph images of the plumes above the YSZ and Nd: YAG
   targets showed dark straight tracks produced by large particles. The
   formation of large (similar to 10 mu m) particles is tentatively
   attributed to cracking of the solidified melt at the bottom of the
   ablation crater. This is supported by the fact that no large particles
   are ejected from graphite, which sublimes without melting. Further
   support to this hypothesis is provided by numerical 3D modelling of
   melt cooling in craters produced by laser pulses of different shapes.

   including mass transport on a composite catalytic surface. We show that

   contradict the prescription of the detailed balance principle for the
   relation between the rate constants for adsorbate diffusion jumps via
   the boundary and desorption from different areas, and, for certain
   parameters, the predictions of their model are qualitatively
   inconsistent. Quantitatively, their results are inconsistent in the
   situations where the role of the diffusion jumps from the catalytically
   active regions to the inactive regions is significant. (C) 2009

TI Frequency dependence of the coefficient of microwave radiation
   reflection from magnetic fluid at liquid nitrogen temperatures
SO TECHNICAL PHYSICS
LA English
DT Article
AB The coefficient of microwave radiation reflection from a plane layer of
   a magnetic fluid magnetized by a magnetic field of 11.5 kOe is measured
   in the temperature range 253-293 K. The concentration of the magnetic
   phase (magnetite) is 15 vol %. In this temperature range, the dynamic
   susceptibility of nanoparticles exhibits strong dispersion
   (ferromagnetic resonance). Experimental data are treated by invoking
   the theory of high-frequency magnetization of an ensemble of
   interacting isotropic superparamagnetic particles. It is shown that,
   when the temperature drops below the room value, the trends observed at
   elevated temperatures (a decrease in the fraction of the power
   reflected from the magnetic fluid and an increase in the frequency of a
   minimum in the frequency dependence of the power) are retained.

   these conditions, the conversion of graphite into a carbon condensate
   reaches 98 wt % and the contents of carbon nanotubes and nickel in this
   condensate are 72 and 10 wt %, respectively. Sequential treatment with
   nitric and hydrochloric acids has made it possible to extract purified
   carbon nanotubes and nickel nanoparticles coated with a carbon shell
   (approximately 50 nm thick) in which the nickel content is 4 wt %. Data
   are presented on the diameters of the prepared nanotubes and on the

ID MICROSTRUCTURED REACTORS; THIN-FILMS; HYDROGENATION; OXIDATION; SUPPORTS
AB A new generation of nanostructured Pt-Sn/TiO2 catalytic thin films has
   been developed by deposition of Pt-Sn mixed-metal precursors from
   organic solvents on mesoporous TiO2/Ti films with a thickness of
   200-300 nm. The titania sot was obtained by templating a TiO2 precursor
   with Pluronic F127 surfactant. The films were prepared on Ti substrates
   by spin-coating. The influence of the F127/Ti ratio in the range
   between 0.006 and 0.050, the pH of the titania sot between 1.5 and 2.0,
   and the aging time between 8 and 240 h on the morphology and porous
   structure of titania films was investigated. A TiO2 film with the
   highest degree of the long-order structure was obtained at a
   surfactant/Ti molar ratio of 0.009, a pH of 1.5, and an aging time of
   24 h. This film has a hexagonal pore structure with a mean pore size of
   3.5 rim and a porosity of 25%. A powder titania support with a similar
   chemical composition and morphology was also produced and used for
   optimization of an active component deposition. The Pt-Sn carbonyl
   [Pt-3(CO)(3)(SnCl3)(2)(SnCl2 center dot H2O)](n)(-2n) clusters were
   synthesized separately from monometallic precursors. They were loaded
   onto the TiO2 supports by impregnation or adsorption. The adsorption of
   the Pt-Sn precursor for 24 h from an ethanol solution with
   concentrations of Pt and Sn of 2.0 and 1.2 mg/ml, respectively,
   followed by a vacuum treatment at 463 K, resulted in Pt-Sn
   nanoparticles embedded in the mesoporous titania network. An average
   size of bimetallic nanoparticles was 1.5-2 nm with a narrow particle
   size distribution. A reaction rate in terms of TOF between 0.2 and 3.3
   min(-1) was observed in the hydrogenation of citral over the Pt-Sn/TiO2
   catalysts. The selectivity to the unsaturated alcohols was as high as
   90% at a citral conversion above 95%. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

ID EXPOSURE
AB Background: Aerosol lung administration is a convenient way to deliver
   water-insoluble or poorly soluble drugs, provided that small-sized
   particles are generated. Here, for the outbred male mice, we show that
   the pulmonary administration of ibuprofen nanoparticles requires a dose
   that is three to five orders of magnitude less than that for the orally
   delivered particles at the same analgesic effect.
   Method: The aerosol evaporation-condensation generator consisted of a
   horizontal cylindrical quartz tube with an outer heater. Argon flow was
   supplied to the inlet and aerosol was formed at the outlet. The
   particle mean diameter and number concentration varied from 10 to 100
   nm and 10(3) - 10(7) cm(-3), respectively. The analgesic action and
   side pulmonary effects caused by the inhalation of ibuprofen
   nanoparticles were investigated.
   Results: The chemical composition of aerosol particles was shown to be
   identical with the maternal drug. Using the nose-only exposure
   chambers, the mice lung deposition efficiency was evaluated as a
   function of the particle diameter.
   Conclusions: The dose-dependent analgesic effect of aerosolized
   ibuprofen was studied in comparison with the oral treatment. It was
   found that the dose for aerosol treatment is three to five orders of
   magnitude less than that required for oral treatment at the same
   analgesic effect. Accompanying effects were moderate venous hyperemia
   and some emphysematous signs.

   nanoparticles) is investigated in a wide temperature interval. It is
   demonstrated that water is structured near the porous surface of a
   solid body and acquires low-dimension topology coinciding with the
   fractal dimension of the porous surface. A correlation is established
   between variations in the nanoparticle diffusion coefficient and the
   dielectric properties of aqueous organic solutions with an organic
   component in the mixture.

AB Structural transformations in dispersions of micron-sized iron
   particles suspended in a magnetite ferrofluid (the colloidal suspension
   of ferromagnetic nanoparticles in nonmagnetic liquid) are theoretically
   considered. An attempt is made to explain the tendency of iron
   particles to form doublets and longer chain aggregates with finite
   distance between particles in external magnetic field observed in
   recent experiments; in colloidal ferrofluid, micron-sized iron
   particles approach one another to finite distance that is equal
   approximately to the particle diameter. At moderate magnetic fields,
   minimal distance between approached particles is nearly independent of
   the strength of magnetic field. In ordinary magnetorheological
   dispersions, which are suspensions of magnetizing micron-sized
   particles in nonmagnetic liquid, the approach of particles practically
   does not occur up to their physical contact.

AB This paper reports on the results of investigations of the
   electrophysical characteristics of films based on conjugated organic
   molecules of copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) and the perylene derivative
   3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic acid dianhydride mixed with TiO2
   microparticles and SnO2 nanoparticles. The electrical resistivity of
   the mixed films under investigation lies in the range from 5 x 10(8) to
   5 x 10(9) GQ cm. The influence of adsorption on the surface of the
   films on the electrical conductivity is studied using vapors of water
   and volatile organic compounds, such as ethanol, ammonia, toluene, and
   acetone, at pressures in the range from 10(-1) to 10 Pa. The adsorption
   of acetone and toluene vapors does not lead to considerable changes in
   the electrical conductivity of the films, whereas the exposure to
   vapors of water, ethanol, and ammonia results in a reversible multiple
   increase in the electrical conductivity of the studied films. In the
   case of mixed CuPc/TiO2 films, the electrical conductivity observed
   upon adsorption of ammonia vapors on the film surface exceeds the
   initial conductivity by a factor of approximately 2500. The mechanisms
   of the observed changes in the electrical conductivity are discussed
   with allowance made for the increase in the electron density of the
   films due to the electron exchange with adsorbed molecules of reducing
   gases.

   coatings on active metal nanoparticles were studied in this work. The
   passivation processes involved in the formation of coatings on
   nanoparticles were analyzed by SEM, TEM, XRD, EDS, DTA-TG and chemical
   analysis. Inorganic passivation coatings for aluminum nanopowders were
   more effective in terms of thermal stability than organic ones. The
   stability of organic passivation coatings to further oxidation did not
   depend on the type of coating, but instead depended on the particle
   size of the passivated powders. A new advanced approach involving a
   metal nanopowder passivation technique has been applied.

   their bond with the polymer matrix. Using model gel systems, it was
   shown that solid-phase sonosensitizers enhance local thermal effects

   composite components in one common process. This method permits to
   obtain the nanocomposite materials with the uniform distribution of

   concentration in the nanocomposite film was shown to lead from one hand
   to the progressive fall of both the Young's modulus and yield stress
   and from another hand to the rise of the ultimate deformation and
   thermal expansion coefficient values. These effects were ascribed to
   the formation of the excessive free volume in the material along with
   the raise of silica concentration.

   hydrogen-related species (HRS). Specific features of SiQD and HRS bands
   are the nanosecond kinetics and unusual "stepped" PL excitation
   spectrum in the 3.5-7.5 eV range. The possible origin of discovered

   The electron emission analog of optical Urbach rule for low-sized

   dominant phase of electron emission process. The structure and energy
   parameters of studied samples were obtained. It was revealed that thin

ID BA2TI9O20
AB The mechanism of solid-phase interaction in synthesis of BaTi4O9 is
   investigated using initial mixtures characterized by different degrees
   of dispersion and prepared by three methods: (i) mechanical mixing and
   grinding of initial components, (ii) coprecipitation from aqueous
   solutions of salts, and (iii) the citrate-nitrate sol-gel technique.
   The use of initial mixtures consisting of nanoparticles in the
   synthesis makes it possible to decrease the sintering temperature by
   100-300A degrees C, which ensures the preparation of single-phase
   samples, and to reduce several times the heat treatment time.
   Dilatometric investigations of the sintering process in the synthesis
   of BaTi4O9 from the initial mixtures under study indicate that the
   maximum change in the linear sizes of samples occurs in the temperature
   range 1000-1250A degrees C. It is shown that, in this temperature
   range, the concurrently formed impurity phases undergo decomposition
   and the growth rate of BaTi4O9 crystals increases. The optimum

AB Stable amorphous potassium peroxostannate nanoparticles with controlled
   sizes (10-100 nm), morphology, and hydrogen peroxide percentage (19-30
   wt %) were synthesized for the first time. The compounds were
   characterized by vibrational spectroscopy, Sn-119 MAS NMR spectroscopy,
   powder X-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetry. These characteristics
   were compared to those for K2Sn(OH)(6) and K2Sn(OOH)(6). Potassium
   peroxostannate particles are mainly built of peroxo-bridged polymer
   chains. The particles are stable when stored in a dry state or
   suspended in nonaqueous solvents; in contact with water, they release
   hydrogen peroxide.

   omega. The principle of the generalized spin echo and the results of
   mathematical modeling are confirmed in experiments on inelastic
   scattering on magnetic fluids and polymer solutions. The developed
   method makes it possible to study the features of the dynamics of
   atomic and molecular systems, e.g., to analyze soft vibrational spectra

AB The processes of a thermal impact on Ni nanoclusters with a radius of
   up to 0.8 nm have been studied by means of molecular dynamics with the
   use of a tight-binding potential. The simulation indicates that the
   structural transition from the initial fcc phase to the icosahedral
   modification occurs under the influence of temperature. The transition
   temperature is shifted towards the cluster melting temperature with an
   increase in the cluster size. A similar behavior has been observed for
   copper and gold nanoparticles. A conclusion has been drawn that 200-250
   atoms is presumably the limiting size of a metallic cluster, below
   which the initial fcc modification cannot be kept under realistic
   industrial conditions. The adequacy of the results is checked in the
   computer experiments with Lennard-Jones nanoparticles. The results for
   the Lennard-Jones and metallic nanoparticles have been shown to agree

AB We propose a freezing ferromagnetic moment model to explain the

   most recently. The model assumes that in the antiferromagnetic
   nanosystem, the disorder surface spins are frozen at low temperature
   along magnetic filed direction, forming a ferromagnetic layer. Then
   this results in an exchange bias. After some proper simplification, we
   get the magnetization at different applied field by the minimal energy
   calculation using MATLAB. Our model computerizing indicates the
   exchange bias shift of the magnetization curve is -48.2 Oe for n = 100
   antiferromagentic layers, which matches the observed value very well.

ID SIZE-DEPENDENCE; WORK FUNCTION
AB Regularities of the self-organization of bimodal ensembles of
   nanoparticles into crystalline structures in metal lyosols are studied
   by the Brownian dynamics method. Differences in the thicknesses of
   adsorption layers, van der Waals, elastic, and electrostatic
   interactions, and random and dissipative forces, as well as variations
   in interparticle electrostatic interactions due to electron tunneling
   are taken into account in the model. Pair potentials for polydisperse
   ensembles of particles are analyzed and the correlation between the
   pattern of potential curves and the type of forming structures is
   revealed. The possibility of the selective coagulation of particles
   with different sizes by virtue of dissimilar charging at the moment of
   their approach is demonstrated. The kinetics of this process is
   investigated. Specific features of the crystallization of bimodal sols
   are discussed using real gold organosols as examples.

AB Small systems composed of 10 molecules of poly-p-xylylene or a TiO2
   cluster (rutile) surrounded by 10 molecules of poly-p-xylylene are
   modeled via the method of molecular dynamics. The thermodynamic
   characteristics, structure, and mobility of poly-p-xylylene chains in
   the model systems are studied in a wide temperature interval (195-995
   K) and compared with the corresponding characteristics of a volume
   phase and an individual polymer chain. With increasing temperature, the
   mobility of monomer units increases; this process leads to disordering.
   At high temperatures, there is an evident tendency for loosening and
   further disintegration of an aggregate into individual chains, which
   adopt a Gaussian coil shape. These transitions are similar to the
   transitions of the folded individual molecule of poly-p-xylylene.
   Introduction of a TiO2 nanoparticle into poly-p-xylylene has a strong
   effect on the characteristics of the system with short polymer chains,
   where the adhesion of poly-p-xylylene molecules on the TiO2 surface is
   accompanied by disordering in the peripheral region.

   unfit for the preparation of highly dispersed catalysts due to
   hydrolysis taking place after dilution and/or interaction with a basic

   oligomeric Pt nitrate complexes are not cleaved even after refluxing

AB To better understand the specifics of nuclear magnetic resonance and
   spin relaxation in systems with magnetic nanoparticles and test the
   limits of the outer sphere model for the diffusion-related relaxation,
   iron oxide nanoparticle suspensions are studied in dependence on the
   particle concentration and size (5-40 nm). The model is modified to
   account for aggregation of the particles into clusters with an enlarged
   effective radius. For liquid suspensions containing small particles or
   clusters, both the longitudinal and transverse spin relaxation rates,
   T-1(-1) and T-2(-1), correspond well to the theory, which predicts
   passing of T-1(-1) through a maximum and monotonic increase in T-2(-1)
   with increasing particle size. For the largest particle sizes, as well
   as in the case of strong aggregation, the relaxation rates are
   significantly lower than theoretical predictions. An abrupt change in
   both the relaxation rates is observed in a narrow temperature range
   around the melting point of paraffin wax doped with magnetic
   nanoparticles. The applicability of fast-motion and fast-diffusion
   approximations is discussed for large effective sizes and limiting
   molecular motion cases.

AB The relationship between static and dynamic models of the nanoparticle
   structure is considered based on the analysis of magic properties of
   silver clusters (results of molecular dynamics experiments). Dynamics
   of silver nanoclystals with cuboctahedral morphology in the nanosize
   range is characterized by the cooperative motion of atoms in the layers
   equidistant from the nanoparticle mass center. In this case, the
   cuboctahedral nanoparticles pass in a more stable icosahedral shape.
   The motion of atoms in a stable icosahedral cluster passes into a
   stationary oscillation mode (diffusion is absent). The distribution of
   middle positions around which atoms in a cluster oscillate suggests
   that the clusters simultaneously exhibit the properties of a liquid
   (reduced density that approaches the melt density) and a solid. The
   clusters have the regular non-crystalline structure (the shells of
   atoms equidistant from the cluster center form the Platonic and
   Archimedean bodies).

AB A quasidynamic compaction technique is used to produce a mesostructural
   composite that represents the matrix framework from the base material
   filled with inclusions. The size of the latter is comparable with the
   matrix grain size. The mesostructural composite base is the powder of
   electrolytic copper or internally oxidized copper subjected to
   mechanical alloying with a nanocomposite. The latter is a mixture of 60
   % of copper and 40 % of nanosized TiB2 particles. Due to high
   deformations the material exhibits the microstructure self-organization
   and the constant size of reinforcing TiB2 particles in the inclusions.
   Mechanical properties of the mesostructural composite exceed
   considerably those of the composite matrix. Mechanical properties of
   alloys from the internally oxidized copper matrix and 6-9 vol. % of
   TiB2 nanoparticles are close to properties of copper-based alloys with
   18 vol. % of TiB2 nanoparticles. The electrical resistance of the
   mecsostructural composite with the internally oxidized copper matrix
   (6-9 vol. % of TiB2 nanoparticles) is 2-4 % higher than that of
   internally oxidized copper and the electrical resistance of the
   copper-based alloy (18 vol. % of TiB2 nanoparticles) is 8 % higher.

AB Gold nanoparticles supported on metal oxide are important
   nanomaterials; their applications as biochemical sensors, in optical
   industry and catalysis have received much attention. The most of gold
   clusters properties (at first, catalytic activity) strongly depend on a
   particle size, shape, and type of support. Different quantum-chemical
   methods: density functional theory with nonempirical local functional
   PBE, MP2 perturbation theory, and coupled cluster method with single
   and double substitutions CCSD are used to study structure and
   properties of Au-n, to simulate the influence of ZrO2 support on Au-6
   structure. Since the information about the strength and nature of
   interaction of nanoparticles with reactants is very important to
   understand the mechanisms of catalytic reaction, theoretical data about
   the adsorption of molecules (H-2, O-2, hydrocarbons) on gold
   nanoclusters are presented. A gold atom has a rather large nuclear
   charge, and therefore relativistic effects should be taken into
   account. For this reason we used the SBK effective core potential and
   extended basis functions for describing external electron shells.
   Possibilities and limitations of each method are also discussed.

AB The kinetic characteristics of the oxidation of iron monosulfide with
   molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide in a neutral aqueous medium were
   studied. The rate of oxidation of FeS with oxygen was proportional to
   the concentration of O-2 and quadratically depended on the initial
   concentration of FeS, W (0) = k (ef) [FeS](2)[O-2], where k (ef) = (2.5
   +/- 0.5) x 10(5) M-2 s(-1) (pH 8, 22A degrees C). During the oxidation
   of FeS, the iron ion retained the valence state +2. Oxidation products
   contained about 50% elemental sulfur. The interaction of FeS with H2O2
   was characterized by the half-time of reaction less than 15 s. The
   products of oxidation of initially nontoxic FeS contained toxic
   compounds, supposedly the sulfoxylate ion HS (2) (-) .

   have closely spherical shape with the mean size in the range 20-70 nm
   in diameter dependently of process parameters. Nested "onion-like"
   Structure of nanoparticles was observed. The mean value of interlayer
   distance in the (0 0 0 1) direction, is about 0.6358 +/- 0.031 nm. Due

AB The synthesis of CdS nanoparticles stabilized in the bulk of a

   is determined by means of transmission electron microscopy. The
   composition of nanoparticles is defined by X-ray phase analysis. It is
   shown that the variation of the process-dependent parameters during
   synthesis of nanoparticles in a polymer + oil solution melt results in
   the formation of CdS nanoparticles with average sizes of 4.9, 5.4, and
   6.2 nm with a reasonably narrow size distribution and well-formed
   structure. The optical properties of synthesized nanomaterials are
   investigated. The investigation of Raman scattering reveals softening
   of the LO-phonon mode with decreasing CdS nanoparticle size. A broad
   high-energy band of photoluminescence connected with the exciton
   annihilation in conditions of size quantization is detected.

AB The formation of CoFe2O4 nanocrystals under hydrothermal conditions at
   a temperature of 130A degrees C is investigated. The average size of
   CoFe2O4 particles varies from 6 to 11 nm depending on the synthesis
   time. The hydrothermal medium is heated by two different methods, i.e.,
   the microwave (with a synthesis time from 1 min to 2 h) and
   conventional (with a synthesis time from 30 min to 45 h) methods. It is
   demonstrated that the use of microwave heating considerably accelerates
   the formation of CoFe2O4 particles. Preliminary ultrasonic treatment
   for 3 min increases the phase formation rate in the case of microwave
   heating and hardly affects the occurrence of the process upon
   conventional heating. It is revealed that the exposure of the initial
   mixture (preliminarily treated with ultrasound) to room temperature for
   2 h or longer almost completely reduces the efficiency of the action of
   ultrasonic treatment on the phase formation process under hydrothermal
   conditions.

AB The paper is devoted to electron paramagnetic resonance investigation
   of nanoparticles and aggregates of nanoparticles formed by pyrolysis of
   propane as well as a mixture of propane and iron pentacarbonyl. The
   measurement showed that the pyrolysis of the C3H8 plus Ar mixture
   results in the formation of a carbonaceous phase (phase I), which is
   quite different from that formed by the C3H8 plus Fe(CO)(5) plus Ar
   mixture (phase II). In phase I there is a strong oxygen effect for
   as-prepared samples; 75% of spins are accessible to the environmental
   gas via the interconnected system of microvoids and microchannels. In
   phase II there was a weak oxygen effect for the as-prepared samples.
   However, after exposition of phase II to air for 160 h, the properties
   of phase II have become about the same as that of phase I. A strong
   oxygen effect was observed for the air-exposed phase II. The line width
   for phase II increases monotonically with the iron content in the
   sample. This increase is probably related to the dipole-dipole
   interactions between the radical centers and the iron atoms distributed
   throughout the carbon matrix.

AB A simple and available method is proposed for the synthesis of
   cobalt-containing nanoparticles. This method comprises cobalt formate
   thermolysis in hydrocarbon oil without extra stabilizing ligands. The
   size, composition, and structure of the nanoparticles are determined by
   transmission electron microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, and
   electron diffraction. The average particle size is 10-14 nm. The major
   components are cobalt oxides CoO and Co3O4. Apart from these oxides,
   the particles contain minor metallic cobalt.

AB Optical absorption of leucoosapphire and polycrystalline corund
   (polycor) is studied after irradiation with cobalt ions and subsequent
   annealing in a vacuum. The structure of states localized in the
   forbidden band and induced by various imperfections has a higher
   stability to annealing as compared to the case of implantation of other
   types of ions into aluminum oxide. The fan-like behavior of the
   dose-dependent absorption spectra is a consequence of the
   defect-induced disordering of crystal lattices. It is determined that
   intrinsic radiation-induced defects, substitutional defects, complexes
   containing them, and Co nanoparticles have an influence on the
   parameters of the focal point of the absorption spectra. The parameters
   of the interband and exponential absorption demonstrate the formation
   of a new multidefect material with a band gap width ranging from 5.3 to
   5.5 eV and an absorption edge at 2.0-5.2 eV caused by the localized
   states of defect clusters.

   elasticity. A procedure allowing to measure the oscillation-damping
   coefficient (attenuation coefficient, of oscillations) and to obtain on
   this base the value of shear viscosity in MF samples under study
   determined by the magnetic field strength is proposed. The measured
   results of the field dependence on viscosity in a sample with a volume
   concentration of solid phase, of 5% do not contradict the concept of
   "rotational viscosity" of the diluted disperse system of magnetic
   nanoparticles. We can interpret, the data obtained for a MF sample,
   with the concentration 16.6% by chain-forming aggregates in it.

AB A preparation procedure was developed, and samples of nanodisperse Fe3+
   hydroxide with a narrow particle-size distribution (2.5-3.5 nm) were
   synthesized. The occurrence of a substructure in the bulk of Fe3+
   hydroxide nanoparticles was detected for the first time using
   light-field and dark-field transmission electron microscopy. It was
   found that structurally ordered regions with sizes of 1.0 nm, which
   were disoriented with respect to each other at angles of a few degrees,
   occurred in the bulk of the nanoparticles. The empirical formula of
   nanodisperse iron hydroxide was Fe2O3 center dot 1.8H(2)O; the
   structure of this hydroxide contained crystal water, OH-, and O2-. The
   coordination number of Fe3+ cations with respect to oxygen was 6. It
   was found that both structural and nonstructural water can be removed
   almost completely from the bulk of nanoparticles in the course of
   sample heating to 150-250A degrees C in a vacuum with the retention of
   their amorphous character and observed sizes. In the course of
   dehydration, the mutual mobility of nanoparticles within aggregates was
   retained in Fe3+ xerogels; this resulted in a decrease in the total
   pore volume, whereas the volume of mesopores with diameters of 3.4-3.5
   nm progressively increased. The micropore structure of the samples of
   nanodisperse iron hydroxides was studied by the molecular probe method
   using the low-temperature (77 K) sorption of nitrogen and molecular
   hydrogen. It was found that, along with micropores of volume 0.02
   cm(3)/g, which are accessible to both of the sorbates, the sorption of
   H-2 exhibited an additional specific absorption of 1.0-1.7
   cm(3)(STP)/g, which can be interpreted as an additional ultramicropore
   volume accessible to only hydrogen molecules.

   size on the stability of the structural modifications obtained has been
   investigated. The dependence of the process of the cluster-structure
   formation on the conditions of cooling from the liquid state has been
   noted. Upon slow crystallization, an fee structure was mainly formed,
   whereas upon rapid cooling an icosahedral phase was formed in the
   majority of cases. Thus, the simulation performed indicates the
   possibility of some control of the structure formation of Cu and Ni
   clusters upon crystallization.

AB Experiments were performed to estimate the time of isothermal
   transformation of model hydrocarbons (ethylene, benzene, and
   naphthalene) to solid carbon nanoparticles. An optical procedure
   combined with a shock tube was used to experimentally study the
   duration of the initial reaction stages before the occurrence of
   emission with a continuous visible spectrum. This emission is caused by
   the new (condensed and not gaseous) phase of carbon atoms formed in
   hydrocarbon pyrolysis behind a reflected shock front. The measurements
   are based on recording the time of occurrence of emission at a
   wavelength lambda = 750 nm. The durations of the induction periods are
   in the range 12-160 A mu sec and decrease with increasing temperature
   in the range 1920-2560 K for each hydrocarbon, and also with increasing
   number of carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon molecule. The apparent
   activation energies for the formation of nanodispersed carbon particles
   were estimated from the measured durations of the initial reaction
   stages: 204 kJ/mole for ethylene, 65 kJ/mole for benzene, and 44
   kJ/mole for naphthalene.

AB The temporal variation in electron and ion concentrations have been
   measured in shock-heated mixtures of Ar + (0-2)% C3O2 in the 2000-3600
   K temperature and 15-30 bar pressure range. Experiments in pure argon
   proved that the observed free electrons and ions originate from
   inherent impurities of sodium. The equilibrium concentrations of free
   charges in argon were established during (1-3) x 10(-5) s and varied
   from 4 x 10(11) cm(-3) at T-5 = 2500 K to 5 x 10(12) cm(-3) at 3500 K.
   In the reactive mixtures, containing C3O2, the time profiles of
   electron and ion concentrations showed a more complicate behavior-a
   fast rise to a maximum followed by a gradual decay. The maximum ion
   concentrations were much higher and electron concentrations were much
   lower than in similar conditions in argon. The extent of the subsequent
   decay of electron concentration increased proportionally to the square
   of the C3O2 concentration. In the mixture with 2% C3O2 the final
   electron concentration was about 100 times less than in pure argon. The
   characteristic decay, time of free charges varied from 400 to 40 mu s
   and decreased proportionally to the square root of the charge
   concentration. The data analysis is based on the assumption that the
   observed redistribution of electron and ion concentrations is caused by
   charging of the carbon particles formed during Pyrolysis of C3O2. The
   kinetics of particle charging and the final distribution of charges
   were evaluated by the analysis of electron and ion fluxes to the
   particles-in accordance with the electric potentials of charged
   particles and corresponding sodium ionization. A predominance of
   negatively charged particles, caused by the high electron mobility,
   resulted in their much higher concentration than the concentration of
   free electrons. (c) 2009 The Combustion Institute. Published by

   TiO2-supported Au and Au-Pd samples demonstrate stable and efficient
   DMDS removal at temperature as low as 155 A degrees C, with formation
   of the two products: SO2 and elemental S. On the contrary, no formation
   of elemental S is detected in the case of Au, Au-Rh, and Au-Pd
   catalysts supported on HZSM-5, H-beta, or MCM-41. The most active
   Au-Rh/HZSM-5 catalyst demonstrates an efficient DMDS removal at 290 A
   degrees C, with quantitative DMDS-to-SO2 oxidation. Characterization of
   catalysts with TPR, XRD, and (XANES + EXAFS) confirms a high dispersion
   of the metallic phases in all catalysts under study. Specific
   interaction between nano-particles of gold and titanium dioxide surface
   could be responsible for the unusual catalytic behavior of Au/TiO2
   samples, as distinct from Au/zeolitic systems.

AB The dependence of electrical conductivity on the concentration of CdS
   (c) and temperature (T) over the temperature range 10-300 K was studied
   for poly-p-xylylene-CdS (PPX + CdS) nanocomposites prepared by
   solid-state cryochemical synthesis. The results were discussed in terms
   of the heterogeneous conductivity model including various charge
   transfer mechanisms in various nanocomposite regions. Under the
   illumination of a film with c > 11 vol % by a daylight lamp, the
   conductivity increased, and the sigma(T) dependence was metallic in
   character at low temperatures. The photoconductivity of films at larger
   concentrations c was caused by the appearance of photoexcited electrons
   in CdS nanoparticles, the separation of charges at the
   nanoparticle-matrix boundary, and percolation effects in films. The PPX
   matrix was shown to actively participate in electrical conductivity;
   electrons in this matrix jumped between phenyl rings. The experimental
   dependence of dark conductivity sigma(T) at temperatures from 150 to
   300 K was analyzed using the Mott hopping conductivity model with
   variable jump lengths. The main points of the Mott theory of hopping
   conductivity were discussed.

AB The thermal decomposition of cobalt formate in a flow of an inert gas
   led to the formation of cobalt nanoparticles in pores of various
   substrates (silica gel, alumina, activated carbon, and
   montmorillonite). Electron microscopic studies showed that the
   particle-size distribution of cobalt depended on the external magnetic
   field strength; the average particle size and distribution variance
   decreased as the field strength increased. It was assumed that the
   external magnetic field affected the nucleation constant of cobalt
   nanoparticles.

AB The effective-medium model has been generalized within the dipole
   approximation, with allowance for the shape anisotropy and dynamic
   depolarization of semiconductor nanoparticles. The calculations
   revealed nonmonotonic dependences for the birefringence and dichroism
   on the nanoparticle size. Comparison of the measured and calculated
   refractive index dispersion of birefringent porous silicon layers in
   the near-IR region indicates that consideration for the dynamic
   depolarization gives a better description of the optical properties for
   this material in comparison with the generally used effective-medium
   electrostatic approximation.

AB The optical absorption spectra of molybdenum disulfide prepared by
   monolayer dispersion of a crystalline precursor in a liquid medium were
   studied. On the whole, the three-dimensional structure of the
   crystalline analogue was reconstructed in disperse MoS2 dried to a
   powder state. A substantial fraction of the material transformed into a
   nanosized state during dispersion and was stabilized in the form of
   nanoparticles in various solvents. The stabilizing action of the
   solvents studied decreased in the series acetonitrile, ethanol >
   chloroform > water. The data on the optical absorption of MoS2
   suspensions in various solvents were evidence of a broad particle-size
   distribution. Along with nanoscale particles, the samples contained
   larger particles responsible for long-wave absorption (> 600 nm). The
   size of nanoparticles was estimated using an empirical correlation
   between the position of maximum A (the long-wave maximum of the first
   allowed absorption band) in the absorption spectrum and the size of
   particles (2R). This correlation was obtained using the literature data
   on monodisperse particles and mixtures of particles. The number of
   particles showed a tendency to increase as the concentration of
   disperse MoS2 in acetonitrile decreased.

   applications in a new generation of light sources for an overhead
   illumination. In this work we discuss mechanisms of emission
   enhancement in nanoparticles doped with rare earth or/and transition
   metal ions. Arguments are presented that phosphors of nanosize may emit
   light more efficiently and thus be applied in practical optoelectronic
   devices.

   formation of metal particles, which occurs after an induction period
   and affects the polystyrene fluorescence.
